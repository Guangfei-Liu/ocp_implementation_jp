=== Transcript
Authorization policies determine whether a user may perform a given _action_ within a project. This lets platform administrators use the _cluster policy_ to control who has various access levels to the OpenShift Enterprise platform itself and all projects. It also lets developers use _local policy_ to control who has access to the developers' own projects.

Authorization is a separate step from _authentication_, which is more about determining the identity of the person taking the action.
