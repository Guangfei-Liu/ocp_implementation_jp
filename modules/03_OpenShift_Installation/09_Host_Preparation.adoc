.Host Preparation - Password-less communication

* Ensure Installer has password-less access to all Hosts.
* Ansible, which is used to run the installation process, requires a user that has access to all hosts. For running the installer as a non-root user, passwordless sudo rights must also be configured on each destination host.
* For example, you can generate an SSH key on the host where you will invoke the installation process:
+
----
# ssh-keygen
----

NOTE: Do not use a password.

** An easy way to distribute your SSH keys is by using a bash loop:
+
----
# for host in ose3-master.example.com \
    ose3-node1.example.com \
    ose3-node2.example.com; \
    do ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub $host; \
    done
----

NOTE: Modify the host names in the above command according to your configuration.
