.Overview

* The Kubernetes pod scheduler is responsible for determining placement of new
pods onto nodes within the cluster.
* It reads data from the pod and tries to find a node that is a good fit based
on configured policies.
* It is completely independent and exists as a standalone/pluggable solution.
* It does not modify the pod and just creates a binding for the pod that ties
the pod to the particular node.
