.Route Types - Secured Routes

* Secured routes specify the TLS termination of the route and, optionally,
provide a key and certificate(s).

NOTE: TLS termination in OpenShift relies on
link:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Server_Name_Indication[SNI] for serving
custom certificates. Any non-SNI traffic received on port 443 is handled with TLS
termination and a default certificate (which may not match the requested hostname,
resulting in validation errors).
