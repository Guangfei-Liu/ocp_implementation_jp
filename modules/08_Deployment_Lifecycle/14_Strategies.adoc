.Custom Strategy

The Custom strategy allows you to provide your own deployment behavior.

* The following is an example of the Custom strategy:
+
[source,json]
----
"strategy": {
  "type": "Custom",
  "customParams": {
    "image": "organization/strategy",
    "command": ["command", "arg1"],
    "environment": [
      {
        "name": "ENV_1",
        "value": "VALUE_1"
      }
    ]
  }
}
----
+
** In the above example, the organization/strategy Docker image provides the
deployment behavior. The optional command array overrides any CMD directive
specified in the imageâ€™s Dockerfile. The optional environment variables provided
  are added to the execution environment of the strategy process.

* Additionally, OpenShift provides the following environment variables to the
strategy process:
|====
|Environment Variable|Description
|OPENSHIFT_DEPLOYMENT_NAME| The name of the new deployment (a replication controller).
|OPENSHIFT_DEPLOYMENT_NAMESPACE| The namespace of the new deployment.
|====
** The replica count of the new deployment will initially be zero. The
responsibility of the strategy is to make the new deployment active using the logic that best serves the needs of the user.
