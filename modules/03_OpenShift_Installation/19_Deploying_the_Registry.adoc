== Deploying the Registry
:noaudio:

* OpenShift can build Docker images from your source code, deploy them, and
manage their lifecycle. To enable this, an internal, integrated Docker registry
should be deployed in your OpenShift environment.
* OpenShift runs the registry in a pod on a node, just like any other workload.
* Using the command below creates a *service* and a *deployment configuration*,
both called "docker-registry".
Once deployed successfully, a pod is created with a name similar to docker-registry-1-cpty9.

* If you wanted to control where your registry gets deployed, you can specify
desired target using the "--selector" flag by picking the labels you want to
match.
