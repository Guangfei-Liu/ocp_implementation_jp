.Users and User Types

* *Service accounts* - These are special system users associated with projects;
* When a `pod` requires access to make an API call to the OSE master, a
`ServiceAccount` is created to represents the pod's credentials.
* some *Service Accounts* are created automatically when the project is first
created
* users can create more for the purpose of defining access to the contents of
each project or to make API calls to the OSE master.
*** Service accounts are represented with the `ServiceAccount` object.
*** For example : _system:serviceaccount:default:deployer_ and  _system:serviceaccount:foo:builder_

=== Transcript
Service accounts are special system users associated with projects, they allow
Pods (in the project) to make queries/API calls to the OpenShift Master.

We will discuss Service Accounts later in this module.
