== Prerequisites
.DNS Setup

* A wildcard for a DNS zone must ultimately resolve to the IP address of the OpenShift router.
* For example, create a wildcard DNS entry for cloudapps, or something similar, that has a low TTL and points to the public IP address of the host where the router will be deployed:
+
----
*.cloudapps.example.com. 300 IN  A 192.168.133.2
----

* In almost all cases, when referencing VMs you must use host names, and the host names that you use must match the output of the hostname -f command on each node.
