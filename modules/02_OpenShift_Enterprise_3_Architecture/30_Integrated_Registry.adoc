=== Transcript

OpenShift Container Platform provides an integrated Docker registry. This
automatically provides users with a place to which their builds can push the
 resulting images.

Whenever a new image is pushed to the integrated registry, the registry notifies
OpenShift Container Platform about the new image and passes along image information,
such as the namespace, name, and image metadata.

Various pieces of OpenShift Container Platform react to the new images by creating new
builds and deployments.
