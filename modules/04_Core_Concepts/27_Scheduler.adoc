=== Transcript

A user can configure configurable predicates to tweak their function.

A user can give a configurable predicate any user-defined name. The predicate
 type is identified by the argument that it takes.

A user working with configurable predicates can configure multiple predicates
 of the same type but with different parameters as long as the predicates have
  different user-defined names.
