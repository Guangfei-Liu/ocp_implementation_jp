.Labels - Continued

* Labels are simple key/value pairs, as in the following example:
+
[source,yaml]
----
 labels:
   key1: value1
   key2: value2
----

* Consider:
 ** A pod consisting of an *nginx* docker container, with the label
 *role=webserver*.
 ** A pod consisting of an *Apache httpd* docker container, with the same label
 *role=webserver*.
 ** A service or replication controller that is defined to use pods with the
 *role=webserver* label treats both of these pods as part of the same group.

* Here is an example how you would remove all the components with the same label
*app=mytest*.

----
# oc delete all -l app=mytest
