=== Transcript

Here is an example of a secured route definition using re-encryption termination.

Note the following:

. The `termination` field is set to `reencrypt`. Other fields are the same as in edge termination.
. Optionally, the `destinationCaCertificate` field specifies a CA certificate to validate the endpoint certificate, securing the connection from the router to the destination.
