.Pods Overview - Continued

* OpenShift treats pods as largely "static"; changes cannot be made to
a pod definition while it is running.

* OpenShift implements changes by terminating an existing pod and recreating it
with modified configuration, base image(s), or both.
* Pods are also treated as expendable, and *do not maintain state* when recreated.
* Therefore pods should usually be managed by higher-level _controllers_ rather
than directly by users.
