.Configurable Predicates
* These predicates can be configured by the user to tweak their function.
** They can be given any user-defined name.
** The type of the predicate is identified by the argument that they take.
* Since these are configurable, multiple predicates of the same type (but
  different configuration parameters) can be combined as long as their
  user-defined names are different.
