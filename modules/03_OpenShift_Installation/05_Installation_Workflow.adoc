=== Transcript

Use this workflow to install OpenShift Container Platform. You start by making sure that
 the system prerequisites have been met. These are the basic requirements for a
  viable OpenShift Container Platform environment. They include setting up the DNS
   requirements and preparing the hosts for OpenShift Container Platform deployment.

Next, you use the CLI installation utility to install the OpenShift Container Platform
 software.

Finally, you deploy some containerized infrastructure components such as the
 default router and the integrated Docker registry. You also configure
  authentication and set up an NFS server to serve your persistent volume
   requests.
