=== Transcript
//ISSUE: is this slide too much a repeat? or is it solidifying knowledge?

S2I builds are a replacement for the build process of OpenShift Enterprise Version 2. The developer now needs to provide only the repository where the project is located and a builder image, which defines the language and framework used for writing the application.

S2I then assembles a new image that runs the application defined by the source, using the framework defined by the builder image. You can customize the assembly process to fit different approaches.
