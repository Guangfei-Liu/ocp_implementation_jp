=== Transcript

After you first create a quota in a project, the project restricts your ability
 to create any new resources that may violate a quota constraint until it has
  calculated updated usage statistics.

If your modification to the project exceeds a quota usage limit, the master
 denies the action and returns an appropriate error message. The error includes
  the quota constraint that was violated and the system's currently observed
   usage statistics.
