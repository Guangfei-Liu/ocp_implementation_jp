=== Transcript

OpenShift Container Platform 3 provides several predicates out of the box.

You can customize some of these predicates by providing certain parameters.
 You also can combine multiple predicates to provide additional filtering of
  nodes.

There are two kinds of predicates, _static_ and _configurable_. The next few
 slides discuss them.
