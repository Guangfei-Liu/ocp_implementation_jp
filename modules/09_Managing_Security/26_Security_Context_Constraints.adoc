=== Transcript
In addition to _authorization policies_ that control what a user can do,
 OpenShift Enterprise provides _security context constraints_, or SCCs, that
  control the actions that a pod can perform and what it can access.

SCCs are objects that define a set of conditions that a pod must run with to be
 accepted into the system. SCCs let an administrator control the
following:

* Running of privileged containers
* Capabilities a container can request to be added
* Use of host directories as volumes
* SELinux context of the container
* User ID within the container
