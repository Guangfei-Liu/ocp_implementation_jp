.Containers Continued

* The Linux kernel has been incorporating capabilities for container technologies
for years.
* More recently the link:https://www.docker.com/whatisdocker/[Docker project]
has developed a convenient management interface for Linux containers on a host.
* OpenShift and Kubernetes add the ability to orchestrate Docker containers across
multi-host installations.

NOTE: Though you do not directly interact with Docker tools when using
OpenShift, understanding Docker's capabilities and terminology is
important for understanding its role in OpenShift and how your
applications function inside of containers.
