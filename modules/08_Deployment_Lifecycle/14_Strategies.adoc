=== Transcript
A deployment configuration declares a strategy that is responsible for executing
 the deployment process.

Each application has different requirements for availability and other
 considerations during deployments.

OpenShift Enterprise provides out-of-the-box strategies to support a variety of
 deployment scenarios.

The `Rolling` strategy is the default strategy if a deployment configuration
 does not specify a strategy.
