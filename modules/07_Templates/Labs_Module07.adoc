== Templates Lab

=== Overview

In this lab, you create and use templates. This lab has two sections.

.Create and Upload Template

In this section you create a template for a two-tier application (front end and database), upload it into the shared namespace (the `openshift` project), and ensure that users can deploy it from the web console.

.Use Templates and Template Parameters

In this section you create two separate template instances in two separate projects and establish a front-end-to-database-back-end connection by means of template parameters.

== Create and Upload Template

=== Install Template

The example in this section involves building an application and a service with two pods: a front-end web tier and a back-end database tier. This application uses auto-generated parameters and other useful features of OpenShift Container Platform.  Note that as part of its JSON configuration, embedded in the source code, this application contains predefined connectivity between the front-end and back-end components. You add resources in a later lab.

This example is, in effect, a quick start--a predefined application that comes in a template and that you can immediately use or customize.

. As `root` on the master host, download the template definition file:
+
----
[root@master1 ~]# wget http://www.opentlc.com/download/ose_implementation/3.1/resources/Template_Example.json
----

. Create the template object in the shared `openshift` project:
+
----
[root@master1 ~]# oc create -f Template_Example.json -n openshift
----
+
----
template "a-quickstart-keyvalue-application" created
----

[NOTE]
=====
* Creating a template in a project is also referred to as _uploading_ the template.
* The `Template_Example.json` file defines a template. By creating it, you added it to the `openshift` project. To make the template available only for specific projects, add it to those projects, not to the `openshift` project.
=====

=== Create Instance of Template

. Use your browser to connect to the OpenShift web console at `https://master1-GUID.oslab.opentlc.com:8443`.
. Log in as `andrew` with the password `r3dh4t1!`.
. Accept the untrusted certificate if you have not done so already.

. Click *New Project* in the top right corner.

. Specify the project name, display name, and description:
* *Name*: `instant-app`
* *Display Name*: `instant app example project`
* *Description*: `A demonstration of an instant app or template`
+
[TIP]
====
You can also perform this step from the command line:

----
[root@master1 ~]$ oadm new-project instant-app --display-name="instant app example project" \
    --description='A demonstration of an instant-app/template' \
    --node-selector='region=primary' --admin=andrew
----
====

. On the `instant-app` project's *Overview* screen, click *Add to project*.

* In the *Filter by name or application* input field, type `keyvalue`.

* This familiar screen now displays something new: an _a-quickstart-keyvalue-application_, which is a special kind of template, that you previously added to the `openshift` project.

* The idea behind an instant application is that, when you create a template instance, you already have a fully functional application. 
* In this example, your instant application is just a simple web page for key-value storage and retrieval.

. Click *a-quickstart-keyvalue-application*.
* The template configuration screen is displayed.

. Specify options for instantiating the application components:
.. Set the `ADMIN_PASSWORD` parameter to your favorite password.
.. Add a label named `version` with the value `1`.

. Click *Create* to instantiate the services, pods, and replication controllers.
* The build starts immediately.

. Wait for the build to finish. You can browse the build logs to follow its progress.

=== Use Application

* After the build is complete, visit your application at `http://example-route-instant-app.cloudapps-GUID.oslab.opentlc.com/`.
+
[NOTE]
Be sure to use HTTP and _not_ HTTPS. HTTPS does not work for this example because the form submission was coded with HTTP links.

== Use Templates and Template Parameters

Quick starts are useful, but there are times when developers want to build components manually. In this exercise, you treat the quick-start example as two separate applications to be wired together.

=== Deploy Ephemeral Database Back End

. Use your browser to connect to the OpenShift web console at `https://master1-GUID.oslab.opentlc.com:8443`.
. Log in as `marina` with the password `r3dh4t1!`.
. If prompted, accept the untrusted certificate.
. Create a project for the database back end:

.. Click *New Project* button in the top right corner.

.. Specify the project name, display name, and description:
* *Name*: `templates`
* *Display Name*: `Templates Testing Project`
* *Description*: `Project for testing templates`
+
[TIP]
=====
You can also perform this step from the command line:
----
[root@master1 ~]$ oadm new-project templates --display-name="Templates Testing Project" \
    --description='Project used to test templates' \
    --admin=marina
----
=====

. Deploy an ephemeral MySQL database:
.. From the `templates` project's *Overview* screen, click *Add to project*.
.. Scroll down to *Data Stores*, or type `mysql` in the search field.
.. Select the `mysql-ephemeral` database template.

.. Set the template parameters:
* *DATABASE_SERVICE_NAME*: `database`
* *MYSQL_USER*: `mysqluser`
* *MYSQL_PASSWORD*: `redhat`
* *MYSQL_DATABASE*: `mydb`
+
CAUTION: Make sure you set these values correctly; otherwise the application
 does not connect to the database back end.

.. Click *Create*, and then click *Continue to overview*.
+
[TIP]
=====
You can also create the template instance from the command line:

----
[marina@master1 ~]$ oc new-app --template=mysql-ephemeral --param=MYSQL_USER=mysqluser,MYSQL_PASSWORD=redhat,MYSQL_DATABASE=mydb,DATABASE_SERVICE_NAME=database
----
=====

.. As `marina`, switch to the `templates` project and examine the objects that
 were created as part of the `mysql-ephemeral` template:
+
----
[marina@master1 ~]$ oc get projects
NAME                DISPLAY NAME                STATUS
custom-s2i-script   Custom S2I Build Script     Active
templates           Templates Testing Project   Active
----
+
----
[marina@master1 ~]$ oc project templates
Now using project "templates" on server "https://master1-3191.oslab.opentlc.com:8443".
----
+
----
[marina@master1 ~]$ oc get dc
NAME       REVISION   DESIRED   CURRENT   TRIGGERED BY
database   1          1         1         config,image(mysql:5.7)
----
+
----
[marina@master1 ~]$ oc get service
NAME       TRIGGERS                    LATEST
database   ConfigChange, ImageChange   1
----
* A deployment configuration is available for your instance. The service name is the same as that of your `DATABASE_SERVICE_NAME` parameter.

.. Verify that the values of the environment variables in the deployment configuration (`dc`) are correct:
+
----
[marina@master1 ~]$ oc env dc database --list
# deploymentconfigs mysql, container mysql
MYSQL_USER=mysqluser
MYSQL_PASSWORD=redhat
MYSQL_DATABASE=mydb
----

=== Deploy Application's Ruby Front End

. As `marina`, create an application with the `https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world` Git repository:
+
----
[marina@master1 ~]$ oc new-app -i openshift/ruby https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world \
                          MYSQL_USER=mysqluser MYSQL_PASSWORD=redhat MYSQL_DATABASE=mydb
----

. Verify that your service is in place:
+
----
[marina@master1 ~]$ oc get service
NAME               CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)    AGE
database           172.30.107.208   <none>        3306/TCP   16m
ruby-hello-world   172.30.42.66     <none>        8080/TCP   7s
----

. Create an external route to your front-end application:
+
----
[marina@master1 ~]$ oc expose service ruby-hello-world
route "ruby-hello-world" exposed
----
+
----
[marina@master1 ~]$ oc get route
NAME               HOST/PORT                                                     PATH      SERVICES           PORT       TERMINATION   WILDCARD
ruby-hello-world   ruby-hello-world-templates.cloudapps-72e3.oslab.opentlc.com             ruby-hello-world   8080-tcp                 None
----

* If you do not specify a host name, the default subdomain route creates the route.

. Wait for the build to complete, then test your environment:
+
----
[marina@master1 ~]$ oc logs -f builds/ruby-hello-world-1
... Omitted Output ...

. Wait for the pods to start, then verify that your application is running and connecting to the database:
