=== Transcript

Replication controllers are a core Kubernetes object, `ReplicationController`.

Here is a sample `ReplicationController` definition with some omissions and
 callouts. Note the following:

. This is the number of copies of the pod to run.
. This is the label selector of the pod to run.
. This is a template for the pod that the controller creates.
. Labels on the pod should include those from the label selector.
