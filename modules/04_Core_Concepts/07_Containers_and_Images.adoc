.Docker Images

* You can use Docker directly to build images, but OpenShift also supplies
builders that assist with creating an image by adding your code or
configuration to existing images.

* Since applications develop over time, a single image name can actually
refer to many different versions of the "same" image.
** Each different image is referred to uniquely by its hash (a long hexadecimal
  number e.g. `fd44297e2ddb050ec4f...`) which is usually shortened to 12
characters (e.g. `fd44297e2ddb`).
** Rather than version numbers, Docker allows applying tags (such as `v1`, `v2.1`
  , `GA`, or the default `latest`)
** in addition to the image name to further specify the image desired, so
you may see the same image referred to as `rhel` (implying the `latest`
tag), `rhel:rhel7`, or `fd44297e2ddb`.
