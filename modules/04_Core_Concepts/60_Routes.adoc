.Route Types - Path Based Routes

* Path based routes specify a path component that can be compared against
a URL (which requires that the traffic for the route be HTTP based) such
that multiple routes can be served using the same hostname, each with a
different path.
* Routers should match routes based on the most specific
path to the least; however, this depends on the router implementation. The
following table shows example routes and their accessibility:

|_www.example.com_ |Yes

.2+|_www.example.com_ |_www.example.com/test_ |Yes (Matched by the host, not the
  route)
