== Demonstration Tips

* _Carefully_ read what you are expected to do in each section.
* Do not assume anything--stick to the instructions.
* Do not just copy and paste. Try to understand what you are being asked to do and whether you need to adjust values.
* Practice.
* Feel free to use your own words and flow through the demonstrations, as your situation dictates. However, always remember the limitations of the environment.
* You can run the *Deployment_Post_Script.sh* file on your *ose_fastrax* environment to practice, but its recommended to provision a fresh environment for demonstrations.
