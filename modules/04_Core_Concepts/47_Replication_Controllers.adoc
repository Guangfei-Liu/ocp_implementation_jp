.Replication Controllers Overview

* A replication controller ensures that a specified number of replicas of a pod
are running at all times.
* If pods exit or are deleted, the replica controller acts to instantiate more
up to the desired number.
* Likewise, if there are more running than desired, it deletes as many as necessary to match the number.

=== Transcript

A replication controller job is to ensure that a specified number of replicas of
 a pod are running at all times.

If pods exit or are deleted, the replica controller acts to instantiate more up
to the desired number.

Likewise, if there are more running than desired, it deletes as many as
necessary to match the number.
