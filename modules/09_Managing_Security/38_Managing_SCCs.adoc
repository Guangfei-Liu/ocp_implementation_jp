=== Transcript

You can relax the security in your cluster so that images are not forced to run as a preallocated UID, without granting everyone access to the privileged SCC.

To do this, edit the restricted SCC and change the `RunAsUser` type to `RunAsAny`.

This also lets images run as the root UID if no `USER` is specified in the Dockerfile.
