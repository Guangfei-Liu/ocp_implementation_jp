=== Transcript

OpenShift Enterprise provides an integrated Docker registry. This allows users to automatically have a place to which their builds can push the resulting images. Whenever a new image is pushed to the integrated registry, the registry notifies OpenShift Enterprise about the new image and passes along image information, such as the namespace, the name, and the image metadata.

Various pieces of OpenShift Enterprise react to the new images by creating new builds and deployments.
