=== Transcript
* _Admission_ uses the following approach to create the final security context
 for the pod:
First, retrieve all SCCs available for use.
Next, generate field values for any security context setting that was not
 specified on the request.
Finally, validate the final settings against the available constraints.

If a matching set of constraints is found, then the pod is accepted. If the
 request cannot be matched to an SCC, the pod is rejected.
