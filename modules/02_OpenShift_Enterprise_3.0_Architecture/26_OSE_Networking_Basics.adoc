== OSE Networking Basics
:noaudio:

* To understand the networking workflow in OSE3.0 we need to get familiar with
the following components:
** The `SDN Network` - Every host in the OSE3.0 environment/cluster is a member
of the *SDN Network*.
- Each `Pod` will have it's own IP that is routable from any member of the SDN
(By default: 10.x.x.x)
- Each `Service`, which represents one or more `pods` will have it's own IP
(By default: 172.30.x.x)

=== Transcript

All hosts in the OSE environemnt, or cluster, are members of the same SDN
overlay network.

Each pod gets it's very own IP that is routable from any member of the SDN
network.
Pods come and go, so we use a *service* to represent them and provide a stable
and permanent IP for a group of pods.
