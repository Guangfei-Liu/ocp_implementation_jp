== Demonstration Goals and Audience

.Developer's Day Demonstration Scenario (the Joe track)

* *Goal* - Demonstrate OpenShift Enterprise's ability to simplify and streamline rapid application development
* *Audience* - This is a technical demonstration intended for technical resources, but you can present it at different depths
* Consider your audience's areas of interest and select the most appropriate demo snippets:
** Deploy from prebuilt containers (command line)
** Deploy from an existing Git repository (web console, STI build)
** Deploy a two-tiered application from a template (web console and command line)
