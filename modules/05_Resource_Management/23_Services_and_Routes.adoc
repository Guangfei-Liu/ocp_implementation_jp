* An OpenShift route is a way to announce your service to the world. A route, consumed by a router in conjunction with service endpoints, provides named connectivity from external sources to your applications. Each route provides a name, service selector, and, optionally, security configuration.

* Here is a Route Object Definition:

  "kind": "Route",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "route-unsecure"
  },
  "spec": {
    "host": "www.example.com",
    "to": {
      "kind": "Service",

* OpenShift routers provide external DNS mapping and load balancing to services over protocols that pass distinguishing information directly to the router.
* Routers support the following protocols:
** HTTP
** HTTPS
