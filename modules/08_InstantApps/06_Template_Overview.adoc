.Components continued:

* Labels
** Labels are used to manage and organize generated resources, such as pods. The labels specified in the template are applied to every resource that is generated from the template.
** Labels are used to organize, group, or select objects and resources.  resources and pods are "tagged" with labels, and then services and replication controllers use labels to indicate the pods they relate to. This makes it possible for services and replication controllers to reference groups of pods, or treat pods with potentially different Docker containers as similar entities.
