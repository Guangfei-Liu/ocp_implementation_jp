=== Transcript

*S2I* stands for Source-to-Image. It is the process OpenShift uses to build a
Container image from a base image and your application source code.

OpenShift Enterprise offers an integrated Docker registry and automated image
builds, enabling both source code deployments leveraging S2I build automation
and binary deployments integrated with your existing build and CI infrastructure.

OpenShift Enterprise also offers configurable deployment patterns, which would
be covered later in the training.
