== Creating New Applications
:noaudio:

.Overview

* You can create a new OpenShift application using the web console or by running
the `oc new-app` command from the CLI.
* OpenShift creates a new application by specifying source code, images, or
templates.
* The `new-app` command looks for images on the local Docker installation (if
  available), in a Docker registry, or an OpenShift image stream.

* If you specify source code, `new-app` attempts to construct a _build
configuration_ that builds your source into a new application _image_.
* It also constructs a *deployment configuration* that deploys that new image,
and a _service_ to provide load balanced access to the deployment that is
running your image.

NOTE: If you specify source code, you may need to run a build with `oc
start-build` after the application is created.
