== Deploying the Registry
:noaudio:

.Storage for the Registry

* The registry stores Docker images and metadata. If you simply deploy a pod with the registry, it uses an ephemeral volume that is destroyed if the pod exits. Any images anyone has built or pushed into the registry would disappear.
* For production use, you should use persistent storage using PersistentVolume and PersistentVolumeClaim objects for storage for the registry.
* For non-production use, other options exist to provide persistent storage for the registry, like the --mount-host option.
* We will not cover this topic in this version of the training, it is covered in the link:https://access.redhat.com/beta/documentation/en/openshift-enterprise-30-administrator-guide/chapter-13-persistent-storage-using-nfs[documentation]
