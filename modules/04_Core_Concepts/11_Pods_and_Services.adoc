=== Transcript

Pods have the following lifecycle: They are _defined_, then they are _assigned_ by the scheduler to run on a specific node. They then _run_ until their container(s) exit or they are removed for some other reason.

Depending on policy and exit code, pods may be removed after exiting, or they may be retained to enable access to their containers' logs.
