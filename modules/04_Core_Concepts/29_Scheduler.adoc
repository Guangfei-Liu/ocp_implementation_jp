You can configure the scheduler by specifying a custom set of priority functions.

OpenShift Enterprise provides several priority functions out of the box. You can
 customize some of them by providing certain parameters.

You can also combine multiple priority functions and give them different weights
 to influence the results of the prioritization process. You must specify a
  weight, which must be a number greater than 0.
