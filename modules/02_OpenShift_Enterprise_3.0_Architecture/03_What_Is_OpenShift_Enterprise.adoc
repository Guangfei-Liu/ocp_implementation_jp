=== Transcript

This module begins with an overview of OpenShift Enterprise design concepts.

OpenShift Enterprise is a Platform-as-a-Service, or PaaS, that is based on industry
standards. OpenShift Enterprise is a self-service platform, meaning that it provides development environments on demand. As a polyglot offering, it includes a
range of languages, frameworks, runtimes, and databases. It also automates
management of the entire application lifecycle: build, deploy, and retire.

OpenShift Enterprise enables collaboration between developers on projects and components.
