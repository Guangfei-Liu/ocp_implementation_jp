* `PersistentVolume` objects created in context of _project_
* User request storage with `PersistentVolumeClaim` object in same project
** Claim lives only in user's namespace
** Can be referenced by pod within same namespace
* Attempt to access persistent volume across project causes pod to fail
* NFS volume must be mountable by all nodes in cluster

=== Transcript

You create `PersistentVolume` objects in the context of a specific _project_. A user can request storage with a `PersistentVolumeClaim` object in the same _project_. The claim lives in the user's namespace, or project and can be referenced only by a pod within that same namespace. Any attempt to access a persistent volume across a project causes the pod to fail.

Each NFS volume must be mountable by all nodes in the cluster.
