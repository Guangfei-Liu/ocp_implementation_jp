== Docker Install
* Docker version 1.6 or later from the rhel-7-server-ose-3.0-rpms repository must be installed and running on master and node hosts before installing OpenShift.
* We will run through the following procedure:
** Install Docker:
+
----
# yum install docker
----

** Edit the /etc/sysconfig/docker file and add --insecure-registry 172.30.0.0/16 to the OPTIONS parameter. For example:
+
----
OPTIONS=--selinux-enabled --insecure-registry 172.30.0.0/16
----

** The --insecure-registry option instructs the Docker daemon to trust any Docker registry on the 172.30.0.0/16 subnet, rather than requiring a certificate.



NOTE: After installing OpenShift, you can choose to link:https://access.redhat.com/beta/documentation/en/openshift-enterprise-30-administrator-guide/chapter-1-installation#securing-the-registry[secure the integrated Docker registry], which involves adjusting the --insecure-registry option accordingly.
