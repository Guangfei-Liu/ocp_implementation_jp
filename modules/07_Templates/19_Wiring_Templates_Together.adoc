== Wiring Templates Together
:noaudio:

.Overview

* Sometimes a user might want to build up the various components manually. (e.g
  DB team deploys DB templates and Dev team deploys the frontend template)
* Let's take our example and treat it like two separate "applications" that we
want to wire together.
- Process and create a template for the "frontend"
- Extract the values of the *mysql* credentials from the config file
- Process and create a template for the "db" and override the values with the
values we extracted from "frontend" config file.
