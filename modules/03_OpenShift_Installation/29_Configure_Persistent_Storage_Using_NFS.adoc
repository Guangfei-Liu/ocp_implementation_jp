.SELinux and NFS Export Settings

* By default, SELinux does not allow writing from a pod to a remote NFS server.
** The NFS volume mounts correctly, but is read-only.
* To enable writing in SELinux on each node:
----
# setsebool -P virt_use_nfs 1
----

* Additionally, each exported volume on the NFS server itself should conform to
the following:
- Each export must be:
----
/example_fs *(rw,all_squash)
----
- Each export must be owned by *nfsnobody*:
----
chown -R nfsnobody:nfsnobody /example_fs
----
- Each export must have the following permissions:
----
chmod 777
----

NOTE: The export above allows arbitrary users and clients to mount this volume.
Exports can be restricted to a range of IP addresses for hosts that will access
the volume. See `man exports` for more information.
