== Overview and design concepts in OSE3.0

=== Example OpenShift 3.0 Workflow

* Example OpenShift 3.0 Workflow

* A simplified way of looking at the OpenShift workflow would be: 
* Users/Automation make calls to the REST API (using the Web Console, Command line, any other method) to change the state of the system.
* Periodically OpenShift reads the userâ€™s desired state and then try to bring the other parts of the system into sync.

* Scenario : OpenShift v3 client can predict a spike in traffic before a specific event (Holiday/Fight/Race/Sports day of any kind) and want to spin up more pods of a specific service/application.

*** For example, lets assume the application is configured to have 3 running pods and the user wants to change that to 6 running pods.
*** User decides to pre-emptively "scale up" to 6 app instances.
**** User makes a call using the Web Console, Command line any other method to state that "this app should have 6 instances"
*** The data store gets updated with the new information (desired scale = 6)
**** On the next sync loop, the Replication Controllers (Will be explained later) actual/current scale (3) doesn't match desired scale (6) 
*** OpenShift causes 3 more instances (pods) to be scheduled and placed for deployment.

* The OpenShift controllers are performing the "business logic" of the system - taking user actions and transforming them into reality.
* How builds are run and launched can be customized independent of how images are managed, or how deployments happen.

* Follow this workflow to get a better understanding of a typical workflow in OpenShift, This example is a simple one and is used only to illustrate the general process in OpenShift and doesn't cover each and every process in the system.
