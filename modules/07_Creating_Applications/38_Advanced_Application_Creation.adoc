.Advanced: Multiple Components and Grouping

* The `new-app` command allows creating multiple applications from source, images,
or templates at once. To do this, simply specify multiple parameters to the
`new-app` call. Labels specified in the command line apply to all objects
created by the single call. Environment variables apply to all components
created from source or images.

* To Create an Application from a Source Repository and a Docker Hub Image:
+
----
$ oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world mysql
----

NOTE: If a source code repository and a builder image are specified as separate
arguments, `new-app` uses the builder image as the builder for the source code
repository. If this is not the intent, simply specify a specific builder image
for the source using the `~` separator.
