.Deployments and Deployment Configurations

* `DeploymentConfig` object defines deployment:

** Elements of `ReplicationController` definition
** Triggers for creating new deployment automatically
** Strategy for transitioning between deployments
** Lifecycle hooks

* Each time deployment is triggered (manual or automatic), deployer pod manages
 deployment:
** Scales down old replication controller
** Scales up new replication controller
** Runs hooks
* Deployment pod remains after deployment to retain logs
* To enable easy rollback, when one deployment is superseded by another,
 previous replication controller is retained

=== Transcript

The OpenShift Enterprise `DeploymentConfig` object defines the following details
 of a deployment:

* The elements of a `ReplicationController` definition
* Triggers for creating a new deployment automatically
* The strategy for transitioning between deployments
* Lifecycle hooks

Each time a deployment is triggered, whether manually or automatically, a
 deployer pod manages the deployment, including scaling down the old replication
  controller, scaling up the new one, and running hooks.

When a deployment is superseded by another, the previous replication controller
 is retained and set to "relica=0" to enable easy rollback if needed.
