.Creating the Build Environment

* To create build environment and *start the build*, use `oc create` on the .json file created earlier:
+
----
$ oc create -f ~/simple-sinatra.json
----

* This creates:
** `ImageRepository` entry
** `BuildConfig`
** `DeploymentConfig`
** `Service`

NOTE: Most time its recommended to use `oc new-app`, This method is described for
rare cases and for learning benifits.

=== Transcript

As shown in the first code sample, you use the `oc create` command to create the build environment and resources.
This does not start the build process for your image but creates the required resources discussed previously.
These include an `ImageRepository` entry, a `BuildConfig`, a `DeploymentConfig`, and a `Service`.

To review what happened, run the command shown in the second code sample.
