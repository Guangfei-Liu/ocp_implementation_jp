== Configure Persistent Storage Using NFS
:noaudio:

.Volume Security

* Users request storage with a `PersistentVolumeClaim`.
** This claim only lives in the user's namespace (project) and can only be referenced by
a pod within that same namespace.
* Any attempt to access a persistent volume across a project causes the pod to
fail.
* Each NFS volume must be mountable by all nodes in the cluster.
