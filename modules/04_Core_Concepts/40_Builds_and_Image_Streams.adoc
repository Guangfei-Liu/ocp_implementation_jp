=== Transcript

The resulting object of a build depends on the type of builder used to create
 it.

For Docker and S2I builds, the resulting objects are runnable images.

For custom builds, the resulting objects are whatever the author of the builder
 image specifies.

For a list of build commands, see the Developer's Guide at the web address shown
 here.
