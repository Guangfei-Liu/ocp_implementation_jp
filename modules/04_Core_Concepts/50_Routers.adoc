.Routers - Overview

* An OpenShift administrator can deploy *routers* (like the HA-Proxy, "Default
Router") in an OpenShift cluster.
* These enable `route` resources created by developers to be used by external
clients.

* OpenShift *routers* provide external hostname mapping and load balancing
to applications over protocols that pass distinguishing information directly to
the router.

* Currently (OSEv3.0.0.0) OpenShift's *Default Router* only support the
following protocols:
- HTTP
- HTTPS

An OpenShift administrator can deploy *routers* (like the HA-Proxy, "Default

be used by external clients.

OpenShift routers provide external hostname mapping and load balancing to
applications over protocols that pass distinguishing information directly to
the router.
