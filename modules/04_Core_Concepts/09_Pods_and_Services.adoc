.Pods Overview

* OpenShift leverages the Kubernetes concept of a `*pod*`, which is one or more
containers deployed together on one host, and the smallest compute unit that can
be defined, deployed, and managed.

* Pods are the rough equivalent of OpenShift v2 gears, with containers
the rough equivalent of v2 cartridge instances.
** Each pod is allocated its own internal IP address, therefore owning its
entire port space, and containers within pods can share their local storage and
networking.
