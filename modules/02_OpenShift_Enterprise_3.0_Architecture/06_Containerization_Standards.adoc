=== Transcript
Red Hat works with the open source community to drive standards for containerization. The main areas are:

* Isolation with Linux containers - Isolating applications on the host operating system, security, and portability across host systems.

* Container format with Docker - Docker is the interface for communications, configuration, data persistence, and provisioning. It is content and infrastructure agnostic.
