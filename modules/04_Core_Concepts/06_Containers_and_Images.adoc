.Docker Images

* Docker containers are based on Docker images.
** A Docker image is a binary that includes all of the requirements for running a single Docker
container, as well as metadata describing its needs and capabilities.
* You can think of it as a packaging technology.
* Docker containers only have access to resources defined in the image, unless
you give the container additional access when creating it.
* By deploying the same image in multiple containers across multiple hosts and
load balancing between them, OpenShift can provide redundancy and horizontal scaling
for a service packaged into an image.
