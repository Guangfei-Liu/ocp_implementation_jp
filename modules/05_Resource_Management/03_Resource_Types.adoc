=== Transcript

When you work with applications--creating, building, scaling, destroying, and
 so on--you manipulate OpenShift Enterprise resources in the
  background.

You can enforce quotas against resources.

OpenShift Enterprise 3 includes different resource types. In this context,
 the term _resources_ can refer to hardware resources, such as memory, CPU,
  and other _platform_ resources, or to OpenShift Enterprise resources, such as
   pods, services, and replication controllers.
