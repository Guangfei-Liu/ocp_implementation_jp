.Grant Access to the Privileged SCC

* In some cases, an administrator might want to allow users or groups outside
the administrator group access to create more privileged pods. To do so, you can:

. Determine the user or group you would like to have access to the SCC.
+
----
$ oc edit scc <name>
----

. Add the user or group to the *users* or *groups* field of the SCC.
.. For example, to allow the *e2e-user* access to the *privileged* SCC, add
their user:
+
[source,yaml]
----
$ oc edit scc privileged
