.Creating routes with the command line

* `Routes` can be a create using an API call or a Object Defenition File
(YAML,JSON) or they can be created by the CLI tool.

* Here is an example of how we can create a route, with a hostname that is
exposing a service called "hello-service" using the CLI:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ oc expose service hello-service --hostname=hello-openshift.cloudapps-r2d2.oslab.opentlc.com
NAME            HOST/PORT                                 PATH      SERVICE         LABELS
hello-service   hello-openshift-r2d2.oslab.opentlc.com             hello-service
----

* To display the *routes* in your current project
+
----

$ oc get routes
NAME                    HOST/PORT                                          SERVICE                   LABELS
hello-openshift-route   hello-openshift.cloudapps-r2d2.oslab.opentlc.com   hello-openshift-service

=== Transcript

As you can see,  we can use the *oc expose* command to create a `route` for
external access to our `service` Note that the route actually routes directly to
 the pods, not to the `service`. The route gets the pod connection details from
 the service.
