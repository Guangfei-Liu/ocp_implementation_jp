== OpenShift Workflow


.Simplified Workflow 
. User/automation calls REST API to change system state
. OpenShift Enterprise periodically reads the userâ€™s desired state
. OpenShift Enterprise tries to sync other parts of system

.Example Scenario
* User predicts a traffic spike before a holiday 
* User wants more pods of specific service/application
* User decides to preemptively scale up to 6 app instances from 3 app instances.

.Process
. User calls to state: "this app should have 6 instances"
. Data store gets new information (desired scale = 6)
. In sync loop, replication controllers see mismatch between current scale (3) and desired scale (6). 
. OpenShift Enterprise schedules and deploys 3 instances (pods).

=== Transcript

A simplified way of looking at the OpenShift Enterprise workflow would be: 

. Users or Automation make calls to the REST API (using the Web Console, Command line, any other method) to change the state of the system.
. OpenShift Enterprise periodically reads the user's desired state
. OpenShift Enterprise then tries to bring the other parts of the system into sync with the desired state.

For example, consider this scenario: An OpenShift Enterprise v3 user is predicting a spike in traffic before a holiday or major sports event. 
The user wants to spin up more pods of a specific service/application to accommodate the additional traffic.

Lets assume the application is currently configured with 3 running pods and the user wants to change that to 6 running pods as a pre-emptive measure.
The user then makes a call using the web console, CLI, or any other method to state that "this app should have 6 instances." 

At this point the data store gets updated with the new information indicating that the desired scale is 6 running pods.
On the next sync loop, the Replication Controllers, which will be explained later, determine that the current scale of 3 running pods does not match the desired scale of 6 running pods. 
This causes OpenShift Enterprise to schedule 3 more instances and place them for deployment.

As you can see, the OpenShift Enterprise controllers are performing the "business logic" of the system by taking user actions and transforming them into reality. 
You can customize how builds are run and launched independently of how images are managed, or how deployments happen.
