.DNS Setup

* A wildcard for a DNS zone must ultimately resolve to the IP address of the
OpenShift router.
* For example, create a wildcard DNS entry for cloudapps in your DNS Server, or
something similar, that has a low TTL and points to the public IP address of the
host where the router will be deployed:
+
----
*.cloudapps.example.com. 300 IN  A 85.1.3.5
----

=== Transcript

In order for our OSE environment to be accessible externally we will create a
wildcard DNS entry that points to the *node* that is hosting our *Default Router
Container*

In our lab and examples this is the *infranode00 server*, if your environments
uses multiple *routers* (HA-Proxy instances), which is likely, you will use an
external load balancer or round-robin setting to use them.
