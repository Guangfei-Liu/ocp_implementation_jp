=== Transcript

Service accounts are special system users associated with a project.

When a pod requires access to make an API call to the OpenShift Enterprise
 master, a `ServiceAccount` is created to represent the pod's credentials.

Some service accounts are created automatically when the project is first
 created. Users can create more service accounts to define access to the
  project's contents or to make API calls to the OpenShift Enterprise master.

Service accounts are represented with the `ServiceAccount` object.
