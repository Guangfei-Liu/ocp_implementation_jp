== Builds and Image Streams
:noaudio:

.Image Streams

* An _image stream_ is similar to a Docker image repository in that it contains
one or more _Docker images_ identified by tags.
** An image stream presents a single virtual view of related images, as it may
contain images from:

. Its own image repository in OpenShift's integrated Docker Registry
. Other image streams
. Docker image repositories from external registries

* OpenShift stores complete metadata about each image (e.g., command, entrypoint,
environment variables, etc.). Images in OpenShift are immutable.

* OpenShift components such as builds and deployments can watch an image stream
and receive notifications when new images are added, reacting by performing a
build or a deployment, for example.
