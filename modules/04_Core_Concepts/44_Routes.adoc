.Secured TLS termination types

* Secured routes can use any of the following three types of secure TLS
termination.

*Edge Termination*

* With edge termination, TLS termination occurs at the
router, prior to proxying traffic to its destination.
* TLS certificates are served by the front end of the router,
so they *must be configured into the route*, otherwise the
router's default certificate will be used for TLS termination.
