=== Transcript
When creating a `source` build, `new-app` tries to determine the language
 to use based on the presence of certain files in the root of the
  repository; for example, if a file called `Gemfile` is present in the
   repository, `new-app` determines that the language is Ruby.

Shown here is a list of languages `new-app` can detect and the files associated
 with them.
