=== Transcript

Here is an example of an unsecured route using a path:
 http://www.example.com/path.

Path-based routing is not available when using passthrough TLS, as the router
 does not terminate TLS in that case and cannot read the contents of the
  request.
  
. The path is the only added attribute for a path-based route.
