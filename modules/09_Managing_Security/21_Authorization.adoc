. OpenShift Enterprise uses the identity and the project-scoped action to find
 all bindings that apply to the user or the user's groups.
. It then uses bindings to locate all the roles that apply.
. Next it uses roles to find all the rules that apply.
. Finally, it checks the action against each rule to find a match.
** If it does not find a matching rule, the action is denied by default.
