=== Transcript

This is an example `DeploymentConfig` definition, with some omissions and items
 called out.

Note the following:

. The `ConfigChange` trigger causes a new deployment to be created any time the
 replication controller template changes.

. The `ImageChange` trigger causes a new deployment to be created each time a
 new version of the backing image is available in the named image stream.

. The default `Rolling` strategy provides a downtime-free transition between
 deployments.
