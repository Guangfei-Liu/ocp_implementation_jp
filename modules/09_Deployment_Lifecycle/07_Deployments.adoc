.Rolling Back a Deployment

* Rollbacks revert an application back to a previous deployment and can be
performed using the REST API or the CLI.
** To rollback to a previous deployment:
+
----
$ oc rollback <deployment>
----

** The deployment configurationâ€™s template will be reverted to match the
deployment specified in the rollback command, and a new deployment will be started.

* Image change triggers on the deployment configuration are disabled as part of
the rollback to prevent unwanted deployments soon after the rollback is complete.
** To re-enable the image change triggers:
+
----
$ oc deploy <deployment_config> --enable-triggers
----
