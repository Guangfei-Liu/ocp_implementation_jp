=== Transcript

Many people like to bundle the concepts of virtual machines, or VMs, together
 with containers, but there are important differences between them.

A virtualized machine includes not only the application and the necessary
binaries and libraries--which may require only tens of megabytes--but also an
 entire guest operating system, which may be tens of gigabytes in size.

The Docker container does away with the guest operating system and contains only
 the application and its dependencies.
It runs as an isolated process in user space on the host operating system,
sharing the kernel with other containers. As a result, it enjoys the resource
 isolation and allocation benefits of VMs, but is much more portable and
  efficient.
