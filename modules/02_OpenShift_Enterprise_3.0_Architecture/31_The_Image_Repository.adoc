== The Image Repository

=== Integrated OpenShift Registry


* OpenShift provides an integrated Docker registry. This allows users to automatically have a place for their builds to push the resulting images.
* Whenever a new image is pushed to the integrated registry:

** Passes along all the information about it, such as the namespace, name, and image metadata.
** Different pieces of OpenShift react to new images, creating new builds and deployments.
