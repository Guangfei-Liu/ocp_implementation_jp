== Deploying the Default HAProxy Router

* The OpenShift router is the ingress point for all traffic destined for services in your OpenShift installation. 
* An HAProxy template router implementation is provided as the default template router plug-in. 
** uses the *openshift3/ose-haproxy-router* repository to run an HAProxy instance alongside the template router plug-in. 
** currently supports only HTTP(S) traffic and TLS-enabled traffic via SNI. *While it is called a "router", it is essentially a proxy*.

* The default routerâ€™s openshift3/ose-haproxy-router container listens on the host network interface.
** unlike most containers that listen only on private IPs, The default router's container listens on external/public ports. 
** The router proxies external requests for route names to the IPs of actual pods identified by the service associated with the route.
