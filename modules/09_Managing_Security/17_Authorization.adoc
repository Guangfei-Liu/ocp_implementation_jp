== Authorization
:noaudio:

.Overview
* Authorization policies determine whether a user is allowed to perform a given
_action_ within a project.
* This allows platform administrators to use the _cluster policy_ to control
who has various access levels to the OpenShift platform itself and all projects.
* It also allows developers to use _local policy_ to control who has access to
their _projects_.

NOTE: Authorization is a separate step from _authentication_, which is more
about determining the identity of who is taking the action.
