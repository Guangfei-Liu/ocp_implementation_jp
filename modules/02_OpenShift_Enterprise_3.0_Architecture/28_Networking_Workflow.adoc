=== Transcript

Let's review the following scenario:
When a user requests a page, by pointing his or her browser to
http://Myapp.MyDomain, DNS resolves that request to the IP address of one of
the nodes that hosts the routing layer.

You would usually create a wildcard Cname record in your DNS server and point
it to the node or nodes that host the router container.

The routing layer, in this case the Router Container, then determines which pod
should get the request and acts as a proxy for the pod.
