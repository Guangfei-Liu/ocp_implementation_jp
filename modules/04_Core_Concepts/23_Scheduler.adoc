.Static Predicates
These predicates do not take any configuration parameters or inputs from the
user. These are specified in the scheduler configuration using their exact name.

* *_PodFitsPorts_* deems a node to be fit for hosting a pod based on the absence
of port conflicts.

* *_PodFitsResources_* determines a fit based on resource availability.
The nodes can declare their resource capacities and then pods can specify what
resources they require.  Fit is based on requested, rather than used resources.

* *_NoDiskConflict_* determines fit based on non-conflicting disk volumes.
It evaluates if a pod can fit due to the volumes it requests, and those that
are already mounted.
* *_MatchNodeSelector_* determines fit based on node selector query that is
defined in the pod.

* *_HostName_* determines fit based on the presence of the Host parameter and a
string match with the name of the host.
