=== Transcript

You can set `HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider` in the `identityProviders`
 stanza to validate usernames and passwords against a flat file generated using
  `htpasswd`. For more information, see the link shown here.

Currently, OpenShift Enterprise supports MD5 and SHA encryption types only. MD5
 encryption, which is the default for `htpasswd`, is recommended.

The flat file is reread if its modification time changes, without requiring a
 server restart.
