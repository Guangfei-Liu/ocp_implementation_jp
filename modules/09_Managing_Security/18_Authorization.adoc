=== Transcript
You manage authorization using rules, roles, and bindings.

*Rules* are sets of permitted verbs on a set of objects--for example, whether
 something can create [verb] pods [object].
*Roles* are collections of *rules*. Users and groups can be associated with,
 or bound to, multiple roles at the same time.
*Bindings* are associations between users and/or groups with a role.
