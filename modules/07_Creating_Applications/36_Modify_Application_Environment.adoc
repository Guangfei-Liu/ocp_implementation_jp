.Object names and Projects

the image used to generate them. You can set the name of the objects produced by
adding a `--name` flag to the command.

* To Create `new-app` Artifacts with a Different Name:
+
----
$ oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world --name=myapp

.Object Project or Namespace
* Normally `new-app` creates objects in the current project. However, you can tell
it to create objects in a different project that you have access to using the
`-n|--namespace` argument.

$ oc new-app https://github.com/openshift/ruby-hello-world -n myproject
