Building on replication controllers, with this concept of deployments, OpenShift Enterprise adds expanded support for the software development and deployment lifecycle.

In the simplest sense, a deployment just creates a new replication controller and lets it start up pods.

OpenShift Enterprise deployments also provide the ability to transition from an existing deployment of an image to a new one, and also to define hooks to be run before or after the replication controller is created.
