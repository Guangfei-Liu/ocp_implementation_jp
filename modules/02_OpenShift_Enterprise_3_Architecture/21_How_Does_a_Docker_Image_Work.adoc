== How Does a Docker Image Work



* Containers launched from read-only templates
* Image consists of series of layers
* Uses union file system
** Combines layers into single image
** Allows branches to form single file system
* Changing Docker image builds new layer
** Only update need be distributed, not entire image

=== Transcript

Docker images are read-only templates from which Docker containers are launched.
Each image consists of a series of layers.
Docker uses union file systems to combine these layers into a single
image.

Union file systems let you transparently overlay files and directories of
 separate file systems,
known as branches, to form a single coherent file
system.

When you change a Docker image--for example, you update an application to a
new version--a new layer gets built. You only need to distribute the update, not
 a whole new image.
