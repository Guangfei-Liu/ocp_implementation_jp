== Lab: Install the client on your workstation

The OpenShift client `oc` is available for Linux, Mac OSX, and Windows. You
can use these clients to perform all tasks in this documentation that make use
of the `oc` command.

=== Downloading The Clients

	Visit [Download Red Hat OpenShift Enterprise Client](https://access.redhat.com/downloads/content/290/ver=3.0.0.0/rhel---7/3.0.0.0/x86_64/product-downloads)
	to download the clients. You will need to sign into Customer Portal.

=== Log In To Your OpenShift Environment

You will need to log into your environment using `oc login` as you have
elsewhere. If you have access to the CA certificate you can pass it to oc with
the --certificate-authority flag or otherwise import the CA into your host's
certificate authority. If you do not import or specify the CA you will be
prompted to accept an untrusted certificate which is not recommended.

The CA is created on your master in `/etc/openshift/master/ca.crt`

    C:\Users\test\Downloads> oc --certificate-authority="ca.crt"
    OpenShift server [[https://localhost:8443]]: https://ose3-master.example.com:8443
    Authentication required for https://ose3-master.example.com:8443 (openshift)
    Username: joe
    Password:
    Login successful.
    Using project "sinatra"

On Mac OSX and Linux you will need to make the file executable

    chmod +x oc

In the future users will be able to download clients directly from the OpenShift
console rather than needing to visit Customer Portal.
