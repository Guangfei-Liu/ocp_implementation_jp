.Secured TLS termination types Re-encryption Termination

*Re-encryption Termination*

* Re-encryption is a variation on edge termination where the router terminates
TLS with a certificate, then re-encrypts its connection to the endpoint which
may have a different certificate.
* Therefore the full path of the connection is encrypted, even over the internal
network. The router uses health checks to determine the authenticity of the host.
