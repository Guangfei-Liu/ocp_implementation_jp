== Installation Methods
:noaudio:

* Currently, There are two types of install methods you can use:
** *Quick Install* - The quick installation method allows you to use an interactive CLI utility to install OpenShift across a set of hosts. The utility is a self-contained wrapper intended for usage on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 host, available at link:https://install.openshift.com[https://install.openshift.com].
** *Advanced Install* - For more complex environments where deeper customization of installation and maintenance is required, an installation process using Ansible playbooks is available. Familiarity with Ansible is assumed.

* In this training we will focus on the Quick Install Method.
