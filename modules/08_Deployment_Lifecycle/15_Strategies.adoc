=== Transcript

The `Rolling` strategy performs a rolling update and supports life-cycle hooks
 for injecting code into the deployment process.

In the example, `timeoutSeconds` is optional. The default value is 120.

 `pre`  and `post` are life-cycle hooks that happen before or after the
 deployment
