== Using Persistent Volumes
:noaudio:

.Overview
* A `PersistentVolume` object is a storage resource in an OpenShift cluster.
* Storage is provisioned by an administrator by creating `PersistentVolume`
objects from sources such as:
** NFS mounts - Supported method
** GCE Persistent Disks (Google Compute)
** EBS Volumes (Amazon Elastic Block Stores)

NOTE: Persistent volume plug-ins other than the supported NFS plug-in, such as
AWS Elastic Block Stores (EBS), GCE Persistent Disks, GlusterFS, iSCSI, and
RADOS (Ceph), are currently in Technology Preview.
