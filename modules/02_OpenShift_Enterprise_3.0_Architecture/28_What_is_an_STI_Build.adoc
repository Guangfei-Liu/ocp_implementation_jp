=== Transcript

In the final portion of this module, we look at builds and OpenShift STI images. 

The STI build process is a process in which a developer points to a code repository in any of the supported frameworks and selects a builder image that would contain the operating system and framework to support the code. OpenShift Enterprise then creates an image based on the builder image that contains the selected code.
