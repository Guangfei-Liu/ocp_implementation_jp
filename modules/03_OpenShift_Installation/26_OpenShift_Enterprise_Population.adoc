=== Transcript

You can also deploy database templates that make it easy to run a database
 instance that other components can use.

For each database--MongoDB, MySQL, and PostgreSQL--two templates are provided.

Use the second code sample shown here to create the core set of database
 templates.

After you create the templates, you can easily instantiate them. This gives the
 templates quick access to a database deployment.
