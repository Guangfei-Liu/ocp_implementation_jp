.Webhook Triggers - GitHub webhooks

* GitHub webhooks handle the call made by GitHub when a repository is updated.
* When defining the trigger, you must specify a secret as part of the URL you
supply to GitHub when configuring the webhook.
** The secret ensures that only you and your
repository can trigger the build. The following example is a trigger definition
JSON within the buildConfig:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "type": "github",
  "github": {
    "secret": "secret101"
  }
}
----

** The payload URL is returned as the GitHub Webhook URL by the describe command
  (see below), and is structured as follows:
+
----
http://<openshift_api_host:port>/osapi/v1/namespaces/<namespace>/buildconfigs/<name>/webhooks/<secret>/github
