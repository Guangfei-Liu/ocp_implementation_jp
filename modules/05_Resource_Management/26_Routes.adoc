.Route Types - Path Based Routes

* Path based routes specify a path component that can be compared against
a URL (which requires that the traffic for the route be HTTP based) such
that multiple routes can be served using the same hostname, each with a
different path.
* The following table shows example routes and their accessibility:

.Route Availability
