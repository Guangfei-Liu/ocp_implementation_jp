.Routers Continued

* A router uses the service selector to find the service and the endpoints
backing the service.
* Service-provided load balancing is bypassed and replaced with the router's own
 load balancing.
* Routers watch the cluster API and automatically update their own configuration
 according to any relevant changes in the API objects.
 * Routers may be containerized or virtual.
 ** Custom routers can be deployed to communicate modifications of API objects to another system, such as an *F5*.
