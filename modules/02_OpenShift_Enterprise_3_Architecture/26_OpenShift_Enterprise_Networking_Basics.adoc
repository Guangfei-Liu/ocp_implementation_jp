== OpenShift Enterprise Networking Basics

* OpenShift Enterprise 3 networking basic concepts:
** Every host in OpenShift Enterprise 3 environment/cluster is member of SDN
 network
** Each `pod` has own IP routable from any SDN member
*** Default: `10.x.x.x`
** Each `service` represents one or more `pods`, has own IP
*** Default: `172.30.x.x`

=== Transcript

To understand the networking workflow in OpenShift Enterprise 3, you must be
 familiar with its various components.

All hosts in the OpenShift Enterprise 3 environment, or cluster, are members
of the same SDN overlay network.

Each pod gets its own IP that is routable from any member of the SDN
network.

Pods come and go, so you use a service to represent them and provide a stable
and permanent IP for a group of pods.

The default IPs for pods and services are shown here.
