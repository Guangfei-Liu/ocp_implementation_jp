== Service Accounts

.Overview

* When a person uses the command line or web console, their API token
authenticates them to the OpenShift API.
* However, when a regular user's
credentials are not available, it is common for components to make API calls
independently. For example:

** Replication controllers make API calls to create or delete pods
** Applications inside containers can make API calls for discovery purposes
** External applications can make API calls for monitoring or integration purposes

* Service accounts provide a flexible way to control API access without sharing a regular user's credentials.
