== Security Context Constraints

.Admission

* _Admission control_ with SCCs allows for control over the creation of resources
based on the capabilities granted to a user.

* In terms of the SCCs, this means that an admission controller can inspect the
user information made available in the context to retrieve an appropriate set of
SCCs.
** Doing so ensures the pod is authorized to make requests about its operating
environment or to generate a set of constraints to apply to the pod.

* The set of SCCs that admission uses to authorize a pod are determined by the
user identity and groups that the user belongs to.
** Additionally, if the pod specifies a service account, the set of allowable
SCCs includes any constraints accessible to the service account.
