== Configure Persistent Storage Using NFS
:noaudio:

.SELinux and NFS Export Settings

* By default, SELinux does not allow writing from a pod to a remote NFS server.
** The NFS volume mounts correctly, but is read-only.
* To enable writing in SELinux on each node:
----
# setsebool -P virt_use_nfs 1
----

* Additionally, each exported volume on the NFS server itself should conform to
the following:
- Each export options must be set like the following in the */etc/exports* file:
----
/example_fs *(rw,all_squash)
----
- Each export must be owned by *nfsnobody* and have the following permissions:
----
# chown -R nfsnobody:nfsnobody /example_fs
# chmod 777
----

=== Transcript
To configure SElinux to allow the nodes to use NFS in the way required for OSE
`Persistent Volumes`, use the *setsebool* command as displayed on EACH node.

Also, you will need to configure your NFS server exports as described in this
slide.
