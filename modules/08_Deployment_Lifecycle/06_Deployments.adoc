.Manage Deployments

* Canceling and Retrying a Deployment
** To cancel a running or *stuck* deployment:
+
----
$ oc deploy <deployment_config> --cancel
----
** The cancellation is a best-effort operation, and may take some time to
complete. It’s possible the deployment will partially or totally complete
before the cancellation is effective.

* Retrying a Deployment
** To retry the last failed deployment:
+
----
$ oc deploy <deployment_config> --retry
----
** If the last deployment didn’t fail,
the command will display a message and the deployment will not be retried.
** Retrying a deployment restarts the deployment and does not create a new
deployment version. The restarted deployment will have the same configuration
it had when it failed.
