=== Transcript

A `PersistentVolume` is a specific resource. A `PersistentVolumeClaim` is a request for a resource with specific attributes, such as storage size.

When a request is made, a process matches it to an available volume and binds them together.

This lets you use the claim as a volume in a pod. OpenShift Enterprise finds the volume backing the claim and mounts it into the pod.
