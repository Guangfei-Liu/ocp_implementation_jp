=== Transcript

Docker images are read-only templates from which Docker containers are launched. Each image consists of a series of layers. 
Docker makes use of union file systems to combine these layers into a single image.

Union file systems also allow files and directories of separate file systems, known as branches, to be transparently overlaid to form a single coherent file system. 

When you change a Docker image—for example, when you update an application to a new version—a new layer gets built. You do not need to distribute a whole new image, just the update.
