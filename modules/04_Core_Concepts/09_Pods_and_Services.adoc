=== Transcript

OpenShift Enterprise leverages the Kubernetes concept of a _pod_, which is one
 or more containers deployed together on one host. A pod is the smallest compute
  unit that you can define, deploy, and manage.

Pods are the rough equivalent of  _gears_ in OpenShift Enterprise 2

Each pod is allocated its own internal IP address, thus owning its entire port
 range. Containers within pods can share their local storage and networking.
