=== Transcript

A deployment in OpenShift Enterprise is a replication controller based on a
 user-defined template called a _deployment configuration_. Deployments are
  created manually or in response to triggered events.

The deployment system provides:

* A deployment configuration, which is a template for deployments
* Triggers that drive automated deployments in response to events
* User-customizable strategies to transition from the previous deployment to a
 new deployment
* Rollbacks to a previous deployment
* Manual replication scaling

The deployment configuration contains a version number that is incremented each
 time a new deployment is created from that configuration. In addition, the
  cause of the last deployment is added to the configuration.
