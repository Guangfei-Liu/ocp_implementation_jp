.Pods Recap:
* *Pod* - Application or instance of something
** Similar to *gear* in OpenShift Enterprise 2.x
** Reality is more complex - will learn more moving forward
* Here is a sample Pod definition .json File:

=== Transcript

In the simplest sense, a *pod* is an application or an instance of something. If you are familiar with OpenShift Enterprise version 2 terminology, a pod is somewhat similar to a *gear*.
In reality, pods are more complex, which you will learn as you explore OpenShift Enterprise further.

As shown in the code sample, you use the `oc get pod` command to view pods running in your environment, which is usually your project.
