.Triggers

* A deployment configuration can contain triggers, which drive the creation of
new deployments in response to events, both inside and outside OpenShift.

* If no triggers are defined on a deployment configuration, deployments must be
started manually.
* Configuration Change Trigger
** The ConfigChange trigger results in a new deployment whenever changes are
detected to the replication controller template of the deployment configuration.

** If a ConfigChange trigger is defined on a deployment configuration,
the first deployment will be automatically created soon after the deployment
configuration itself is created.

** The following is an example of a ConfigChange trigger:
+
[source,json]
----
"triggers": [
  {
    "type": "ConfigChange"
  }
]
Image Change Trigger
The ImageChange trigger results in a new deployment whenever the value of an image stream tag changes.

The following is an example of an ImageChange trigger:

"triggers": [
  {
    "type": "ImageChange",
    "imageChangeParams": {
      "automatic": true,
      "from": {
        "kind": "ImageStreamTag",
        "name": "origin-ruby-sample:latest"
      },
      "containerNames": [
        "helloworld"
      ]
    }
  }
]
----

** If the automatic option is set to false, the trigger is disabled.
** With the above example, when the latest tag value of the origin-ruby-sample
image stream changes and the new tag value differs from the current image
specified in the deployment configurationâ€™s helloworld container, a new
deployment is created using the new tag value for the helloworld container
