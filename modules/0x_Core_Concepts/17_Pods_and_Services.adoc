== Pods and Services

.Labels

* Labels are used to organize, group, or select API objects.
**  For example, _pods_ are "tagged" with labels, and then
 _services_ use label selectors to identify the pods they
 proxy to.
** This makes it possible for services to reference groups of pods, even
treating pods with potentially different docker containers as related entities.

* Most objects can include labels in their metadata. So labels can  be used to
group arbitrarily-related objects; for example, all of the _pods_, _services_,
 _replication controllers_, and _deployment configurations_ of a particular
 application can be grouped.
