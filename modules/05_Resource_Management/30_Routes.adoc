=== Transcript

Secured routes can use three types of secure TLS termination.

_Edge termination_ is a type TLS termination that occurs at the router, prior to
 proxying traffic to its destination.

The front end of the router serves the TLS certificates, so they must be
 configured into the route. Otherwise, the router's default certificate is used
  for TLS termination.
