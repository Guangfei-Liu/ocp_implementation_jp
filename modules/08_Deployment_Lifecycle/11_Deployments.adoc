=== Transcript
Rollbacks revert an application back to a previous deployment and can be
 performed using the REST API or the CLI.

The deployment configurationâ€™s template is reverted to match the deployment
 specified in the rollback command, and a new deployment is started.

Image change triggers on the deployment configuration are disabled as part of
 the rollback to prevent unwanted deployments soon after the rollback is
  complete. You can re-enable the triggers with the command shown.
