You can create a configuration from a template file or the management console.
 Using the web console, however, requires the template to be uploaded to
your project or global template library.

You can create a JSON template file and then upload it to your project's
 template library with with the CLI as shown. If you want to upload the JSON
  file to a different project, use the `-n` option with the project's name.

After you upload the template, you can configure it using the web console
 or the CLI.
