.Managing replica count with Replication Controllers
* We can manually adjust the number of *replicas* a pod has by using the *oc scale* command.
* It is not the job of the replication controller to perform auto-scaling based on load or traffic, as it does not track either; rather, this would require its replica count to be adjusted by an external auto-scaler.
* Here is an example ReplicationController definition with some omissions and call-outs:
