=== Transcript

A `PersistentVolume` object is a storage resource in an OpenShift Enterprise
 cluster. An administrator provisions storage by creating `PersistentVolume`
  objects from sources such as the following:

* NFS mounts: This is the supported method.
* GCE Persistent Disks (Google Compute).
* EBS Volumes (Amazon Elastic Block Stores).
* GlusterFS.
* OpenStack Cinder.
* Ceph RBD.
* iSCSI.
* Fiber Channel.

When you define a `PersistentVolume`, you must associate it with a project.
