.Secured TLS termination types - Passthrough Termination

*Passthrough Termination*

* With passthrough termination, encrypted traffic is sent straight to the
destination without the router providing TLS termination. Therefore no
key or certificate is required.

* The destination pod is responsible for serving certificates for the
traffic at the endpoint.

* This is currently the only method that can support requiring client
certificates (also known as two-way authentication).
