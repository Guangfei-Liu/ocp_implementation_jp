.Identity Providers - HTPasswd

* Set _HTPasswdPasswordIdentityProvider_ in the `identityProviders` stanza to
validate user names and passwords against a flat file generated using
http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/programs/htpasswd.html[`htpasswd`].

* Only MD5 and SHA encryption types are supported. MD5 encryption is recommended,
and is the default for `htpasswd`.
** Plaintext, crypt, and bcrypt hashes are not currently supported.

* The flat file is re-read if its modification time changes, without requiring a
server restart.
