.Firewalls: Component Communication

* OpenShift Enterprise relies on `iptables` 
* Must be running, and following ports must be open
* Allows communication between components

=== Transcript

OpenShift Enterprise relies heavily on `iptables` in the background. So `iptables` must be running, and various ports must be open to allow communication between OpenShift Enterprise components.
 
This table shows the ports you need to open. Note that port `4789` must be accessible on any host in the cluster, because it is required for the SDN overlay.

Also note that the master is running a local DNS server. Do not confuse this server with the DNS server that holds the wildcard DNS entry. This is a DNS server (`SkyDNS`) used to resolve local resources--for example, each _service_ you define in OpenShift Enterprise has a `dns` entry that you can resolve locally.
