* Do not take configuration parameters or inputs from user
* Specified in scheduler configuration using predefined names and weight
 calculations

|===================================================================
|Static Predicate |Description
|`LeastRequestedPriority` a|* Favors nodes with fewer requested resources
* Calculates percentage of memory and CPU requested by pods scheduled on node
* Prioritizes nodes with highest available or remaining capacity
|`BalancedResourceAllocation` a|* Favors nodes with balanced resource usage rate
* Calculates difference between consumed CPU and memory as fraction of capacity
* Prioritizes nodes with smallest difference
* Should always use with `LeastRequestedPriority`
|`ServiceSpreadingPriority` |Spreads pods by minimizing number of pods belonging to same service onto same machine
|`EqualPriority` a|* Gives equal weight of *1* to all nodes
* Not required/recommended outside of testing.

=== Transcript

Static priority functions do not take any configuration parameters or inputs
 from the user. The scheduler configuration file specifies these priority
  functions using their predefined names and weight calculations.

The available static priority functions are shown here.
