== OpenShift Enterprise 3.1 Release Notes
:noaudio:

* New Parameter for Port Destination:
** You can now specify the port to send routes to. Any services that are
pointing to multiple ports should have the `*spec.port.targetPort*` parameter
on the pod set to the desired port.

* New Remote Access Command:
** The `oc rsync` command is now available, which can copy local directories into
a remote pod.

* Project Binding Command:
** Isolated projects can now be bound together using `oadm pod-network
join-project`.

* Host Configuration Validation Commands:
** New commands exist to validate master and node configuration files:
 `openshift ex validate master-config` and `openshift ex validate node-config`,
  respectively.
