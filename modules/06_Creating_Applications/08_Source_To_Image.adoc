=== Transcript

The three trigger types include:

* GitHub-specific webhooks, which specify the repository changes, such as a new
commit, that invokes a new build. This trigger is specific to the GitHub API.
* The second trigger type is generic webhooks. This trigger is similar to GitHub
 webhooks in that it invokes a new build whenever it receives a notification.
* And lastly, image change is a trigger that is invoked when a new image is
 available in the specified `ImageRepository` or 'ImageStream'
