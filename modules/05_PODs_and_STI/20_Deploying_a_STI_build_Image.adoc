=== Overview

* Essentially, the STI process is as follows:
** OpenShift sets up various components such that it can build source code into a Docker image.
** OpenShift will then (on command) build the Docker image with the source code.
** OpenShift will then deploy the Docker image as a Pod with an associated Service.
