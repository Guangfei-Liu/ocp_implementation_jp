=== Transcript

Essentially, the S2I process is as follows: OpenShift Enterprise sets up various
 components so that it can build source code into a Docker image. Then OpenShift
  Enterprise builds the Docker image with the source code.
   And finally, OpenShift Enterprise deploys the Docker image as a pod with an
    associated service.
