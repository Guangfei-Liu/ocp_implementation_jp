== Configure Persistent Storage Using NFS
:noaudio:


.Overview

* You can provision your OpenShift cluster with persistent storage using NFS.
* Persistent Volume framework allows administrators to provision a cluster with
persistent storage and gives users a way to request those resources without
having any knowledge of the underlying infrastructure.
* Storage must exist in the underlying infrastructure before it can be mounted
as a volume in OpenShift.
* All that is required for NFS is a distinct list of servers and paths and the
`*PersistentVolume*` API.
