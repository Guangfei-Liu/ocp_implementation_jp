.Grouping Images and Source in a Single Pod
* The `new-app` command allows deploying multiple images together in a single pod.
In order to specify which images to group together, use the `+` separator.
* The `--group` command line argument can also be used to specify which images
should be grouped together.
* To group the image built from a source repository with other images, specify
its builder image in the group.
