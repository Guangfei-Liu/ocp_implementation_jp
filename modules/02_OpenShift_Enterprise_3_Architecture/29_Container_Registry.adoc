=== Transcript


The image registry is a fully integrated Docker v2 registry.
It provides authentication and access control to images.

You can also integrate the registry with third-party providers such as Docker
 Hub to leverage innovation from the community and ISVs.

OpenShift Enterprise uses any server implementing the Docker registry API as a
source of images, including canonical Docker Hub, private registries run by
third parties, and the integrated OpenShift Enterprise registry.
