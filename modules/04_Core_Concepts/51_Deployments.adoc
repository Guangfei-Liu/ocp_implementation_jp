.Deployment Configuration  Definition file/Manifest

* Here is an example _DeploymentConfiguration_ definition with some
omissions and callouts:
+
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: DeploymentConfig
metadata:
  name: frontend
spec:
  replicas: 5
  selector:
    name: frontend
  template: { ... }
  triggers:
  - type: ConfigChange <1>
  - imageChangeParams:
      automatic: true
      containerNames:
      - helloworld
      from:
        kind: ImageStreamTag
        name: hello-openshift:latest
    type: ImageChange  <2>
  strategy:
    type: Rolling      <3>
----

<1> A `ConfigChange` trigger causes a new deployment to be created any time the
replication controller template changes.
<2> An `ImageChange` trigger causes a new deployment to be created each time a
new version of the backing image is available in the named image stream.
<3> The default `Rolling` strategy makes a downtime-free transition between
deployments.

NOTE: We will discuss *Deployment Strategies* in more depth later in the
training.
