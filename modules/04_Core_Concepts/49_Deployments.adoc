.Deployments and Deployment Configurations

* Building on replication controllers, OpenShift adds expanded support
for the software development and deployment lifecycle with the concept
of deployments.
* In the simplest case, a deployment just creates a new replication controller
and lets it start up pods.
* OpenShift deployments also provide the ability to transition from an existing
deployment of an image to a new one and also define hooks to be run
before or after creating the replication controller.
