=== Transcript

The job of a replication controller is to ensure that a specified number of
 replicas of a pod are running at all times.

If pods exit or are deleted, the replication controller acts to instantiate more
 pods up to the desired number.

If there are more pods running than desired, the replication
 controller deletes as many pods as necessary to match the specified number.
