=== Third Party Registries


* OpenShift can make use of third-party registries to obtain: builder images, complete application images, and more. Supportability of these images and registries would fall on their respective creators.
* OpenShift can poll the other registries for changes to image repositories.
** When new images are detected, the same build and deployment reactions described above occur.

* Note : Polling is not implemented yet.
