.Affinity and Anti-Affinity

* Anti Affinity
** Administrators should be able to configure the scheduler to specify
anti-affinity at any topological level, or even at multiple levels.
** Anti-Affinity (or 'spread') at a particular level indicates that all pods
that belong to the same service will be spread across nodes that belong to that
level.
** This ensures that the application is well spread for high availability
purposes.
** The scheduler will try to balance the service pods across all applicable nodes
as evenly as possible.
