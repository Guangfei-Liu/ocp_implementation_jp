=== Transcript

OpenShift Enterprise 3.1 offers several more persistent storage options, including Red Hat's GlusterFS and Ceph RBD, AWS, and Google Compute Engine. Also, NFS storage is now supplemented by iSCSI- and Fibre Channel-based volumes.

It also offers several more middleware options, including JBoss Data Grid and JBoss BRMS, as well as a supported JBoss Developer Studio and Eclipse plug-in.

Finally, the `job` object type is now available, meaning that you can now execute finite jobs on the cluster.
