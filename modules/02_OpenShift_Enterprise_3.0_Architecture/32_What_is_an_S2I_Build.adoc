=== Transcript

In the final portion of this module, we look at builds and OpenShift S2I images.

The S2I build process is a process in which a developer points to a code
repository in any of the supported frameworks and selects a builder image that
would contain the operating system and framework to support the code. OpenShift
Enterprise then creates an image based on the builder image that contains the
selected code.
