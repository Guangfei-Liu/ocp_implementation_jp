.Deployments Overview
* A deployment in OpenShift is a replication controller based on a user defined template called a deployment configuration. Deployments are created manually or in response to triggered events.
* The deployment system provides:
** A deployment configuration, which is a template for deployments.
** Triggers that drive automated deployments in response to events.
** User-customizable strategies to transition from the previous deployment to the new deployment.
** Rollbacks to a previous deployment.
** Manual replication scaling.
* The deployment configuration contains a version number that is incremented each time a new deployment is created from that configuration. In addition, the cause of the last deployment is added to the configuration.
