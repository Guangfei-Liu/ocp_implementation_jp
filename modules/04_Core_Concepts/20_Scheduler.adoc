=== Transcript

The scheduler is responsible for determining placement of new
 pods onto nodes within the OpenShift Enterprise cluster. It reads data from
  the pod definition and tries to find a node that is a good fit based on
   configured policies.

The scheduler is completely independent and exists as a standalone, pluggable
 solution.

It does not modify the pod. It simply creates a binding that ties the pod to
 the selected node.
