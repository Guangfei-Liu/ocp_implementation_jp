== The Build Process

* *Build* - A build is a process of creating runnable images to be used on OpenShift. There are three build strategies: 
** Docker - Invoke docker build, expect a repository with a Dockerfile and directories required for a Docker build process
** S2I - Covered later in this training  
** Custom - A user defined build process, possibly integrating with an existing CI/CD deployment.

=== Transcript

A *build* is a process of transforming input parameters, typically transforming source code into a resulting object, which is typically a run-able image. 
The resulting object depends on the builder used to create the image.
