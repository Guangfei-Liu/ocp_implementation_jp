.Scenario: Client Points Browser to `myApp.MyDomain.org:80`
* DNS resolves to the `host` running the `Default Router` container
** `infranode00` in the lab
* Using `openshift-sdn` overlay network:
** `Default Router` is configured with this network
** Proxies request to internal pod `IP:port` (`10.1.2.3:8080`)

=== Transcript

Consider this following scenario:
A user requests a page by pointing his or her browser to
http://Myapp.MyDomain. DNS resolves that request to the IP address of one of
the nodes that hosts the routing layer.

You would usually create a wildcard Cname record in your DNS server and point
it to the node or nodes that host the router container.

The routing layer, in this case the `Router Container`, then selects the pod
that gets the request and acts as a proxy for the pod.
