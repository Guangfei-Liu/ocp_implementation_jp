.Image Change Triggers

Image change triggers allow your build to be automatically invoked when a new
  of an upstream image is available. For example, if a build is based on top of
a RHEL image, then you can trigger that build to run any time the RHEL image
changes. As a result, the application image is always running on the latest RHEL
base image.

* Configuring an image change trigger requires the following actions:
** Define an ImageStream that points to the upstream image you want to trigger on:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "kind": "ImageStream",
  "apiVersion": "v1",
  "metadata": {
    "name": "ruby-20-rhel7"
  }
}
----
+
*** This defines the image stream that is tied to a Docker image repository
located at <system-registry>/<namespace>/ruby-20-rhel7.
*** The <system-registry> is defined as a service with the name docker-registry running in OpenShift.
