.Configurable Priority Functions
* These priority functions can be configured by the user by providing certain
parameters.
** They can be given any user-defined name.
* The type of the priority function is identified by the argument that they take.
** Since these are configurable, multiple priority functions of the same type
(but different configuration parameters) can be combined as long as their
user-defined names are different.

* *_ServiceAntiAffinity_* takes a label and ensures a good spread of the pods
belonging to the same service across the group of nodes based on the label
values.  It gives the same score to all nodes that have the same value for the
specified label.  It gives a highter score to nodes within a group with the
least concentration of pods.

* *_LabelsPreference_* prefers nodes that have a particular label defined or
not, regardless of its value.
