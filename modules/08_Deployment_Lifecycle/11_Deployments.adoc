.Triggers

* A deployment configuration can contain triggers, which drive the creation of
new deployments in response to events, both inside and outside OpenShift.

* If no triggers are defined on a deployment configuration, deployments must be
started manually.
* Configuration Change Trigger
- The ConfigChange trigger results in a new deployment whenever changes are
detected to the replication controller template of the deployment configuration.

- If a ConfigChange trigger is defined on a deployment configuration,
the first deployment will be automatically created soon after the deployment
configuration itself is created.

** The following is an example of a ConfigChange trigger:
