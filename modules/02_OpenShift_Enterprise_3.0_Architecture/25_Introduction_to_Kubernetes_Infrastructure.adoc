== Introduction to Kubernetes Infrastructure

=== Pods

* A pod (as in a pod of whales or pea pod)
** corresponds to a colocated group of applications running with a shared context.
** Within that context the applications may also have individual cgroup isolations applied.
* A pod models an application-specific "logical host" in a containerized environment.
** It may contain one or more applications which are relatively tightly coupled -- in a pre-container world, they would have executed on the same physical or virtual host.
** For example, a Pod could contain an Web Server and a “file puller/syncer”
* In Kubernetes, rather than individual application containers, pods are the smallest deployable units that can be created, scheduled, and managed.
* In terms of Docker constructs, a pod consists of a colocated group of Docker containers with shared volumes.
