.Affinity and Anti-Affinity

* Affinity
** Administrators should be able to configure the scheduler to specify affinity
at any topological level, or even at multiple levels.
** Affinity at a particular level indicates that all pods that belong to the
same service will be scheduled onto nodes that belong to the same level.
** This handles any latency requirements of applications by allowing
administrators to ensure that peer pods do not end up being too geographically
separated.  If no node is available within the same affinity group to host the
pod, then the pod will not get scheduled.

=== Transcript

Functions based on Affinity and Anti-Affinity are a good place to start when
looking into the possibilities of use for the Scheduler.

Affinity function makes sense when you want all components of a _service_ (By
  This we mean all the pods) to be located in the same "Zone"/"Region"/"Node".
