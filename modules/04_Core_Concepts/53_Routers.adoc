=== Transcript

To reach a router in the first place, requests for hostnames must resolve via DNS to a router or set of routers.

We recommend defining a cloud domain with a wildcard DNS entry pointing to a virtual IP backed by multiple router instances on designated nodes.

In this approach, you need to configure the DNS for each address outside the cloud domain individually. Other approaches may be feasible.
