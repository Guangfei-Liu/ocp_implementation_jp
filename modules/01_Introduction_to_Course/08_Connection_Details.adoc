When connecting to your environment use only your OPENTLC credentials and SSH
key to connect directly into your administration VM. Do not use root or try to
connect directly to the Master or nodes.
Your administration VM (oselab) can be used as a "jump box" to connect via SSH
to the other internal lab hosts.
