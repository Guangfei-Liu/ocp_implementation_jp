== Provision Your Lab Environment

In this lab you use the OPENTLC CloudForms appliance to deploy your lab environment.

=== Overview

To complete the labs for this course, you must first provision the lab environment with the components required to perform the labs.

. Access the link:https://labs.opentlc.com/[OPENTLC lab portal], which is built on top of Red Hat CloudForms to provide a self-service portal.

. Use your credentials to log in.
+
 
[TIP]
====
If you forgot your username or password, link:https://www.opentlc.com/pwm[reset your credentials or obtain a username reminder].
==== 

. Before ordering an environment, you should setup your SSH key and add it to OPENTLC (see section below).

. Navigate to *Services* -> *Catalogs*

. On the left side of the screen, locate and select  *All Services* -> *OPENTLC Openshift Labs* -> *OpenShift 3.5 - Implementation Lab (Rav)*, and
 then click *Order* on the right side of the screen. Read and approve the Runtime Warning.

. Click *Submit* (at the lower right) to order your environment.
** In a few minutes you receive an email describing how to connect to the
 environment.
+
[WARNING]
Do not select *App Control* -> *Start* after ordering the lab. The lab is
 already starting. Selecting *Start* may corrupt the lab environment or cause
  other complications.

. Wait about 20 minutes to allow your environment to build.
. (Optional) Select *Status* to receive an email with the status of your
 environment.

[NOTE]
The lab environment is cloud-based, so you can access it over the wide area network (WAN) from anywhere. Do not, however, expect performance to match a bare-metal environment.


=== Set Up SSH Connection

To access any of your lab systems via SSH, you must use your personal OPENTLC
 SSO username and public SSH key. Unless otherwise noted, you cannot use SSH to
  connect directly as `root`.

[NOTE]
If you have not already done so, you must provide a public SSH key.

. Go to https://www.opentlc.com/update and log in.

. Paste your public key in that location.

. Connect to your administration host via SSH using your OPENTLC username and
 private SSH key.
** Replace _GUID_ in the example below with your personal global unique identifier (GUID), which is
 provided at the top of the lab provisioning email.
** Example using UNIX/Linux:
+
[source,text]
----
ssh -i ~/.ssh/yourprivatekey.key opentlc-username.com@bastion-GUID.oslab.opentlc.com
----
+
[NOTE]
====
* If you are using Windows, use a terminal program such as PuTTY instead of the
 command shown here.

* For more information on using SSH and keys, see https://www.opentlc.com/ssh.html.
====

. Become the `root` user on the administration host:
+
[source,text]
----
[user@bastion-XXXX ~]$ sudo -i
[root@bastion-XXXX ~]#
