Routes can be either secured or unsecured.

Unsecured routes are simplest to configure, as they require no key or
 certificates. However, secured routes offer security for connections to remain
  private.

Secure routes let you use several types of TLS termination to serve certificates
 to the client.

The `Default Router` supports edge, passthrough, and re-encryption termination.
