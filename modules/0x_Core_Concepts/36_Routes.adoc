.Routes

* In order to reach a router in the first place, requests for hostnames
must resolve via DNS to a router or set of routers.
* The suggested method is to define a cloud domain with a wildcard DNS entry
pointing to a virtual IP backed by multiple router instances on designated nodes.
* DNS for addresses outside the cloud domain would need to be configured
individually. Other approaches may be feasible.
