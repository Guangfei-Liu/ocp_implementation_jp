.Image Change Triggers - Continued

* Define a build with a strategy that consumes the image stream:
+
[source,json]
----
{
  "strategy": {
    "type": "Source",
    "sourceStrategy": {
      "from": {
        "kind": "ImageStreamTag",
        "name": "ruby-20-rhel7:latest"
      },
    }
  }
}
----
+
** In this case, the sourceStrategy definition is consuming the latest tag of
the ImageStream named ruby-20-rhel7 located within this namespace.
