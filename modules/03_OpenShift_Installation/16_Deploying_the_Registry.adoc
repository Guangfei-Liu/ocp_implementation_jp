== Deploying the Registry
* OpenShift can build Docker images from your source code, deploy them, and manage their lifecycle. To enable this, OpenShift provides an internal, integrated Docker registry to can be deployed in your OpenShift environment to manage images "locally".
+
----
$ oadm registry --config=admin.kubeconfig \
    --credentials=openshift-registry.kubeconfig 
----

* If you wanted to control where your registry gets deployed, you can use the following 
** This will make sure that the *registry* pod will only be hosted in the "infra" region. 
+
----
$ oadm registry --config=admin.kubeconfig \
    --credentials=openshift-registry.kubeconfig \ 
	   --selector='region=infra' 
----

* This creates a service and a deployment configuration, both called docker-registry. Once deployed successfully, a pod is created with a name similar to docker-registry-1-cpty9.
