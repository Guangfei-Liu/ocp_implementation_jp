== Using Persistent Volumes
:noaudio:

.Volume and Claim Binding
* A `PersistentVolume` is a specific resource.
* A `PersistentVolumeClaim` is a request for a resource with specific
attributes, such as storage size.
* In between the two is a process that matches a claim to an available volume
and binds them together.
** This allows the claim to be used as a volume in a pod.
** OpenShift finds the volume backing the claim and mounts it into the pod.

=== Transcript
A `PersistentVolume` is a specific resource but a `PersistentVolumeClaim` is a
request for a resource with specific attributes, such as storage size.

In between the two is a process that matches a claim to an available volume and
binds them together.

This allows the claim to be used as a volume in a pod.
OpenShift finds the volume backing the claim and mounts it into the pod.
