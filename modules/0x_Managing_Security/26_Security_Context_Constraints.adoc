.Privileged and Restricted SCCs

* The _users_ and _groups_ fields on the SCC control which SCCs can be used.
By default, cluster administrators, nodes, and the build controller are granted
access to the privileged SCC.
* All authenticated users are granted access to the restricted SCC.

* The privileged SCC:
** allows privileged pods.
**  allows host directories to be mounted as volumes.
**  allows a pod to run as any user.
**  allows a pod to run with any MCS label.

* The restricted SCC:
** ensures pods cannot run as privileged.
** ensures pods cannot use host directory volumes.
** requires that a pod run as a user in a pre-allocated range of UIDs.
** requires that a pod run with a pre-allocated MCS label.
