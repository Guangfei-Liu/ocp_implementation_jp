== Configure Persistent Storage Using NFS
:noaudio:

.Enforcing Disk Quotas
* Use disk partitions to enforce disk quotas and size constraints.
** Each partition can be its own export.
** Each export is one persistent volume.
* Unique names enforces for persistent volumes, but the uniqueness of the NFS
volume's server and path is up to the administrator.

* Enforcing quotas in this way allows the end user to request persistent storage
by a specific amount (e.g,, 10Gi) and be matched with a corresponding volume of
equal or greater capacity.

=== Transcript

To define disk quotas you will need to use disk partitions to create size
constraints,  Enforcing quotas in this way allows the end user to request
persistent storage by a specific amount (e.g,, 10Gi) and be matched with a
corresponding volume of equal or greater capacity.
