=== Transcript

Essentially, the S2I process is as follows:
OpenShift Enterprise sets up various components such that it can build source code into a Docker image. OpenShift Enterprise then, on command, builds the Docker image with the source code. And finally, OpenShift Enterprise deploys the Docker image as a pod with an associated service.
