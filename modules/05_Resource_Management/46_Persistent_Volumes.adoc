=== Transcript

To define disk quotas, you need to use disk partitions to create size constraints.

Each partition can be its own export, and each export is one persistent volume.

Using unique names enforces for persistent volumes. However, the administrator
 determines the uniqueness of the NFS volume's server and path.

Enforcing quotas this way lets a user request a specific amount of persistent
 storage--for example, 10GB--and be matched with a corresponding volume of equal
  or greater capacity.
