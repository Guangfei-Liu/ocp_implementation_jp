== Configure Persistent Storage Using NFS
:noaudio:

.Automation
* As discussed, OSE clusters can be provisioned with persistent storage using NFS in
the following way:
- Disk partitions can be used to enforce storage quotas.
- Security can be enforced by restricting volumes to the
namespace that has a claim to them.
- Reclamation of discarded resources can be
configured for each persistent volume.

NOTE: They are many ways that you can use scripts to automate the above tasks.
You can review this
