== Deploying the Default HAProxy Router
:noaudio:

* The OpenShift router is the ingress point for all traffic destined for
services in your OpenShift installation.
* An HAProxy based-router implementation is provided as the default template
router plug-in.
** uses the *openshift3/ose-haproxy-router* image to run an HAProxy instance
alongside and a router plug-in.
** currently supports only HTTP(S) traffic and TLS-enabled traffic via SNI.
** is hosted inside OpenShift like any other workload (eg: the registry)
** *While it is called a "router", it is essentially a proxy*.

* The default routerâ€™s pod listens on its hosts network interface on port 80
and 443.
** unlike most containers that listen only on private IPs, the default router's
container listens on external/public ports.
** The router proxies external requests for route names to the IPs of actual
pods identified by the service associated with the route.
