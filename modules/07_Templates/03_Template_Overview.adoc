=== Transcript

A template describes a set of resources that can be customized and processed to
 produce a configuration.

Each template is a parameterized list that OpenShift Enterprise uses to create a
 list of resources, including services, pods, routes, and build configurations.

A template also defines a set of labels to apply to every resource it creates.
