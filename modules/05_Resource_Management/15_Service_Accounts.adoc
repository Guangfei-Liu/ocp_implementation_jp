.Infrastructure service accounts

* Several infrastructure controllers run using service account credentials.
* The following service accounts are created in the OpenShift infrastructure
namespace at server start, and given the following roles cluster-wide:

** The *replication-controller* service account is assigned the
*system:replication-controller* role
** The *deployment-controller* service account is assigned the
*system:deployment-controller* role
** The *build-controller* service account is assigned the
*system:build-controller* role.

NOTE: Additionally, the *build-controller* service account is included in the
privileged security context constraint in order to create privileged build pods.
