.Concept: "Namespace"
* A Kubernetes namespace provides a mechanism to scope resources in a cluster. In OpenShift, a project is a Kubernetes namespace with additional annotations.
* Namespaces provide a unique scope for:
** Named resources to avoid basic naming collisions.
** Delegated management authority to trusted users.
** The ability to limit community resource consumption.
* Most objects in the system are scoped by namespace, but some are excepted and have no namespace, including nodes and users.
