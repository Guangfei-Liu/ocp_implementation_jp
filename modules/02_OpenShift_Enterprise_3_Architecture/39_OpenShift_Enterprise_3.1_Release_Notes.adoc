== OpenShift Enterprise 3.1 Release Notes
:noaudio:

* Custom CA Certificates:
** You can now specify your own CA certificate during the install, so that
application developers do not have to specify the OpenShift-generated CA to
obtain secure connections.

* DNS Service Name Change:
** The DNS name for service SRV discovery has changed. Services without search
 paths resulted in long load times to resolve DNS. The change reduces load
  times.

* New Parameter Preventing Memory Overload:
** Excessive amounts of events being stored in etcd can lead to excessive memory
 growth.
 ** You can now set the `*event-ttl*` parameter in the master configuration file
  to a lower value (for example, `*15m*`) to prevent memory growth.
