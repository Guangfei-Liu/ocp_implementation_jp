== Security Context Constraints
:noaudio:

.Overview - Continued

* Two SCCs are added to the cluster by default, _privileged_ and _restricted_,
which are viewable by cluster administrators using the CLI:
+
----
$ oc get scc
NAME         PRIV      CAPS      HOSTDIR   SELINUX     RUNASUSER
privileged   true      []        true      RunAsAny    RunAsAny
restricted   false     []        false     MustRunAs   MustRunAsRange
----

* The definition for each SCC is also viewable by cluster administrators using the
CLI. For example, for the privileged SCC:
+
----
# oc export scc/privileged
allowHostDirVolumePlugin: true
allowPrivilegedContainer: true
apiVersion: v1
groups: <1>
- system:cluster-admins
- system:nodes
kind: SecurityContextConstraints
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: privileged
runAsUser:
  type: RunAsAny <2>
seLinuxContext:
  type: RunAsAny <3>
users: <4>
- system:serviceaccount:openshift-infra:build-controller
----

<1> The groups that have access to this SCC
<2> The run as user strategy type which dictates the allowable values for the Security Context
<3> The SELinux context strategy type which dictates the allowable values for the Security Context
<4> The users who have access to this SCC
