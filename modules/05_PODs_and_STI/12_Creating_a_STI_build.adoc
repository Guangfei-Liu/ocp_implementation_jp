== Creating a STI build

=== creating the build file

* To create the instructions/config for our image we use the *psc new-app*  command:

----

$ osc new-app https://github.com/openshift/simple-openshift-sinatra-sti.git -o json | tee ~/simple-sinatra.json

----

* *psc new-app* is a tool that will examine a directory tree, a remote repo, or other sources and attempt to generate an appropriate JSON configuration so that, when created, OpenShift can build the resulting image to run.
** this will also create a service and a route to our pods, but not it *will not* start the build yet.

=== Transcript

* the *osc new-app* command is used to create a JSON file that defines our build, this file can be edited before we create our build.
