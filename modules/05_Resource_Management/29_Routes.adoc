=== Transcript

Secured routes specify the TLS termination of the route. They also have the
 option to provide a key and certificate(s).

TLS termination in OpenShift Enterprise relies on SNI  for serving custom
 certificates. Any non-SNI traffic received on port 443 is handled with TLS
  termination and a default certificate. These might not match the requested
   hostname, resulting in validation errors.
