== Strategies
:noaudio:

A deployment configuration declares a strategy which is responsible for
executing the deployment process.
* Each application has different requirements for availability (and
other considerations) during deployments.
* OpenShift provides out-of-the-box strategies to support a variety of
deployment scenarios.

* The *rolling strategy* is the default strategy used if no strategy is
specified on a deployment configuration.
