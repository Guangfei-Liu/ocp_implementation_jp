== Resource Quota
:noaudio:

.Quota enforcement
* After a quota is first created in a project, the project restricts the ability
to create any new resources that may violate a quota constraint until it has
calculated updated usage statistics.

* If your modification to a project would exceed a quota usage limit, the action
 is denied by the server, and an appropriate error message is returned to the
 end-user. The error explains what quota constraint was violated, and what their
  currently observed usage stats are in the system.
