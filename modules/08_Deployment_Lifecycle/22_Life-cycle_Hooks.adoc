=== Transcript
Every hook has a failure policy that defines the action the strategy should take
 when a hook failure is encountered.

Note that some hook points for a strategy might support only a subset of failure
 policy values. For example, the `Recreate` and `Rolling` strategies do not
  currently support the `Abort` policy for a `post` deployment life-cycle hook.
