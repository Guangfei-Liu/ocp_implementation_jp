.Scheduler Extensibility
As is the case with almost everything else in Kubernetes/OpenShift, the
scheduler is built using a plugin model and the current implementation itself is
a plugin.  There are two ways to extend the scheduler functionality.

* Enhancements
** The scheduler functionality can be enhanced by adding new predicates and
priority functions.  They can either be contributed upstream or maintained
separately.
** These predicates and priority functions would need to be registered with the
scheduler factory and then specified in the scheduler policy file.

* Replacement
** Since the scheduler is a plugin, it can be replaced in favor of an alternate
implementation.
** The scheduler code has a clean separation that watches new pods as they get
created and identifies the most suitable node to host them.
** It then creates bindings (pod to node bindings) for the pods using the master
API.
