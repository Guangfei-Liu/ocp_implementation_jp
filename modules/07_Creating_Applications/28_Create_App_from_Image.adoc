== Create App from Image
:noaudio:

.Specifying an Image - Examples

* To create an application using an image in a private registry, specify the full
Docker image specification.


* To Create an Application from the https://registry.hub.docker.com/_/mysql/[DockerHub MySQL Image]:
+
----
$ oc new-app mysql
----

* To Create an Application from a Local Registry:
----
$ oc new-app myregistry:5000/example/myimage
----


NOTE : If the registry that the image comes from is not secured with SSL, cluster
administrators must ensure that the Docker daemon on the OpenShift nodes is run
with the `--insecure-registry` flag pointing to that registry. You must also
tell `new-app` that the image comes from an insecure registry with the
`--insecure-registry=true` flag.
