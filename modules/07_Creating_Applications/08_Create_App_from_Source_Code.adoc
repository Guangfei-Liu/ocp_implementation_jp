.Language Detection - Continued

* After a language is detected, `new-app` searches the OpenShift server for
image stream tags that have a `supports` annotation matching the detected
language, or an image stream that matches the name of the detected language.
* If a match is not found, `new-app` searches the https://registry.hub.docker.com[Docker Hub
registry] for an image that matches the detected language based on name.
