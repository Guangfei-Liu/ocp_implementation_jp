== OpenShift Container Platform Model

* *Masters*: Responsible for managing system state
** Provide a REST endpoint for interacting with system
** Host the web console for developer access

* *Nodes*: Act as hosts to run containers, based on desired state defined by
 master

=== Transcript

OpenShift Container Platform classifies hosts into two separate yet equally important
groups: masters and nodes.

Masters manage the state of the system, ensuring that all containers that should
be running are running and that other requests are serviced.

OpenShift Container Platform provides a REST endpoint for interacting with the system.
All tools speak directly to the REST APIs: CLI, web console, IDE plug-ins, etc.
Multiple masters can be used to provide high availability at the
management layer.

Nodes act as agents to control and host containers based on the desired state
defined by the master.

Deployments may have several nodes. You can organize nodes into many different
topologies to suit the availability requirements of the workloads.

All members of the OpenShift Container Platform environment/cluster are also members of
 an overlay network based on a software-defined network, or SDN.
