=== Transcript

An OpenShift Enterprise route is a way to expose a service by giving it an
 externally reachable hostname such as `www.example.com`.

A router can consume a defined route and the endpoints identified by its
 service to provide named connectivity that lets external clients reach your
  applications.

Each route consists of a route name, a service selector, and, optionally, a
 security configuration.
