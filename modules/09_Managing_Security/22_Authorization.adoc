.Cluster Policy and Local Policy

* There are two levels of authorization policies:

[cols="1,4"]
|===

|*Cluster policy* |_Roles_ and bindings that are applicable across
all projects. Roles that exist in the cluster policy are considered _cluster
roles_. `Cluster bindings can only reference cluster roles`.

|*Local policy* |_Roles_ and bindings that are scoped to a given
project. Roles that exist only in a local policy are considered _local roles_.
`Local bindings can reference both cluster and local roles`.

|===

* This two-level hierarchy allows re-usability over multiple projects through the
cluster policy while allowing customization inside of individual projects
through local policies.

* During evaluation, both the cluster bindings and the local bindings are used.
For example:

. Cluster-wide "allow" rules are checked.
. Locally-bound "allow" rules are checked.
. Deny by default.
