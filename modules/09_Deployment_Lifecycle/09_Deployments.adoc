* Image Change Trigger
** The ImageChange trigger results in a new deployment whenever the value of an
image stream tag changes.

** The following is an example of an ImageChange trigger:
+
----
"triggers": [
  {
    "type": "ImageChange",
    "imageChangeParams": {
      "automatic": true,
      "from": {
        "kind": "ImageStreamTag",
        "name": "origin-ruby-sample:latest"
      },
      "containerNames": [
        "helloworld"
      ]
    }
  }
]
----

** If the automatic option is set to false, the trigger is disabled.
** With the above example, when the latest tag value of the origin-ruby-sample
image stream changes and the new tag value differs from the current image
specified in the deployment configurationâ€™s helloworld container, a new
deployment is created using the new tag value for the helloworld container
