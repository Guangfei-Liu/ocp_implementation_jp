.Pods Lifecycle

* Pods have a lifecycle they are; *defined*, then they are *assigned* to run on
a node, then they *run* until their container(s) exit or they are removed
for some other reason.
* Pods, depending on policy and exit code, may be removed after exiting, or may
be retained in order to enable access to the logs of their containers.
