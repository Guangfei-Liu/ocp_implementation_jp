=== Transcript

OpenShift Enterprise provides an integrated Docker registry. This 
automatically provides users with a place to which their builds can push the resulting
images.

Whenever a new image is pushed to the integrated registry, the registry notifies
OpenShift Enterprise about the new image and passes along image information,
such as the namespace, name, and image metadata.

Various pieces of OpenShift Enterprise react to the new images by creating new
builds and deployments.
