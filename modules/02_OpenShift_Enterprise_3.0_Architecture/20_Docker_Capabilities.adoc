=== Transcript

With Docker you can build Docker images that hold your applications and create
Docker containers from those Docker images to run your applications.
You can share and reuse those Docker images via Docker Hub or your own registry.

In OSE3.0 we create our own "Integrated registry" to store and distribute
images created locally.
