.Builds Overview

* A build is the process of transforming input parameters into a resulting object.
** Most often, the process is used to transform source code into a runnable image.
** A _BuildConfig_ object is the definition of the entire build process.

* The OpenShift build system provides extensible support for _build strategies_
that are based on selectable types specified in the build API. There are three
build strategies available:

** Docker build
** Source-to-Image (S2I) build
** Custom build

By default, Docker builds and S2I builds are supported.
