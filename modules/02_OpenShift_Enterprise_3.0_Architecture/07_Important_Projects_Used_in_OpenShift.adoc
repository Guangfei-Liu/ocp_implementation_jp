=== Transcript

OpenShift Enterprise v3 comprises several key open source projects, most notable are Kubernetes, Docker, and EtcD.   
Kubernetes orchestrates containers at massive scale and manages and orchestrates Docker containers across clusters of nodes.

Docker is an open source project that automates the deployment of applications inside software containers 
by providing an additional layer of abstraction and automation of operating-system-level virtualization. Docker provides the abstraction for packaging and creating lightweight containers.

EtcD is a highly available key-value store for shared configuration and service discovery. EtcD is the persistent data store for information about the OpenShift environment.  

OpenShift helps manage large developer organizations. OpenShift adds source code management, builds and deployments for developers; manages and promotes images at scale as they flow through the system, manages applications at scale, and tracks teams and users.
