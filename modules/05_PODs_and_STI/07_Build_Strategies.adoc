== Build Strategies

* OpenShift Enterprise build system supports build strategies based on types specified in build API
* Two strategies supported by default:
** Docker builds
*** Invoke `docker build`, expect a repository with a `Dockerfile` and directories required for a Docker build process
*** Suitable for deploying prebuilt Docker container
*** Developer, provider, or ops team needs to create Docker image and inject code into it
** S2I builds
*** S2I - Tool for building reproducible Docker images
*** Produces ready-to-run images by injecting user source into Docker image and assembling new Docker image
*** Created image incorporates base image and built source, ready to use with Docker run
*** Supports incremental builds that reuse downloaded dependencies, built artifacts, etc.

=== Transcript

The OpenShift build system provides extensible support for build strategies based on selectable types specified in the build API. By default, OpenShift Enterprise supports two strategies: Docker builds and S2I builds.

Docker builds invoke the plain `docker build` command, and therefore expect a repository with a `Dockerfile` and all required directories for a Docker build process. This method is suitable for deploying a prebuilt Docker container. With this approach, a developer, provider, or ops team needs to create the Docker image and inject the code into it.

As mentioned earlier, Source-to-Image, or S2I, is a tool for building reproducible Docker images. S2I produces ready-to-run images by injecting a user's source code into an image and assembling a new Docker image. 
The created image incorporates the base image and built source. S2I supports incremental builds that reuse previously downloaded dependencies, previously built artifacts, and so on.

This module focuses on the S2I build strategy.
