== Create App from Image
:noaudio:

.Specifying an Image

* The `new-app` command generates the necessary artifacts to deploy an existing
image as an application. Images can come from image streams in the OpenShift
server, images in a specific registry or https://registry.hub.docker.com[Docker
Hub], or images in the local Docker server.

* The `new-app` command attempts to determine the type of image specified in the
arguments passed to it. However, you can explicitly tell `new-app` whether the
image is a Docker image (using the `--docker-image` argument) or an image stream
(using the `-i|--image` argument).


NOTE: If you specify an image from your local Docker repository, you must ensure
that the same image is available to the OpenShift cluster nodes.
