.Routers

* An OpenShift administrator can deploy _routers_ in an OpenShift cluster.
* These enable routes created by developersto be used by external clients.

* OpenShift routers provide external hostname mapping and load balancing
to _services_ over protocols that pass distinguishing information directly to
the router.
** The hostname must be present in the protocol in order for the router to determine
where to send it.

* Routers support the following protocols:
- HTTP
- HTTPS
