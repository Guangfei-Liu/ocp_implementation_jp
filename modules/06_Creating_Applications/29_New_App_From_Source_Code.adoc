=== Transcript
After a language is detected, `new-app` searches the OpenShift Enterprise server for image stream tags that have a `supports` annotation matching the detected language, or an image stream that matches the name of the detected language.

If no match is found, `new-app` searches the Docker Hub registry for an image that matches the name of the detected language.
