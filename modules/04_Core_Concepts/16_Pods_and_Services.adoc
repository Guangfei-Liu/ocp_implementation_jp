.Service Definition file/Manifest

* Like pods, services are REST objects. The following
example shows the definition of a service for the pod defined above:
+
[source,yaml]
----
 apiVersion: v1
 kind: Service
 metadata:
   name: docker-registry      <1>
 spec:
   selector:                  <2>
     docker-registry: default
   portalIP: 172.30.136.123   <3>
   ports:
   - nodePort: 0
     port: 5000               <4>
     protocol: TCP
     targetPort: 5000 <5>
----

<1> The service name *docker-registry* is also used to construct an
 environment variable with the service IP that is inserted into other
 pods in the same namespace.
<2> The label selector identifies all pods with the
 *docker-registry=default* label attached as its backing pods.
<3> Virtual IP of the service, allocated automatically at creation from a pool
 of internal IPs.
<4> Port the service listens on.
<5> Port on the backing pods to which the service forwards connections.
