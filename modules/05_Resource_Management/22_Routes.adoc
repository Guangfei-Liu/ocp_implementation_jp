.Overview

* An OpenShift route is a way to expose a _service_ by giving it an
externally-reachable hostname like `www.example.com`.

* A defined route and the endpoints identified by its service can be consumed by
a router to provide named connectivity that allows external clients to reach
your applications.
* Each route consists of a route name, service selector, and (optionally)
security configuration.
