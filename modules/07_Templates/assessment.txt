OSEIMPLEMENTATION|OSEIMPLEMENTATION702|5|Templates are comprised of 3 components. Labels are used to organize, group, or select objects and resources. Resources and pods are tagged with labels, and then services and replication controllers use labels to indicate the pods they relate to. This makes it possible for services and replication controllers to reference groups of pods, or to treat pods with potentially different Docker containers as similar entities.|||TRUE|||1|100|||
