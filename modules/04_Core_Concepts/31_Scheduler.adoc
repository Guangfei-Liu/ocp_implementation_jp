.Use Cases

* One of the important use cases for scheduling within OpenShift is to support
flexible affinity and anti-affinity policies.

* OpenShift can implement multiple Infrastructure Topological Levels
** Administrators can define multiple topological levels for their infrastructure
(nodes).
** This is done by specifying labels on nodes
(eg: region = r1, zone = z1, rack = s1).
** These label names have no particular meaning and administrators are free to
name their infrastructure levels anything (eg, city/building/room).
** Administrators can define any number  of levels for their infrastructure
topology, with three levels usually being
adequate (eg. regions --> zones --> racks).
Administrators can specify affinity and anti-affinity rules at each of these
levels in any combination.
