.Route Types - An Unsecured Route with a Path:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: route-unsecured
spec:
  host: www.example.com
  path: "/test"   <1>
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: service-name
----

<1> The path is the only added attribute for a path-based route.

NOTE: Path-based routing is not available when using passthrough TLS, as
the router does not terminate TLS in that case and cannot read the contents
of the request.
