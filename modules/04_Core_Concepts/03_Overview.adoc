=== Transcript

This module provides high-level architectural information on core concepts and
 objects you will encounter when using OpenShift Enterprise.

Many of these objects come from the Kubernetes Project. OpenShift Enterprise
 expands Kubernetes to provide a more feature-rich development lifecycle
  platform.

This module discusses the following:

* Containers and images, which are the building blocks for deploying your
 applications

* Pods and services, which let containers communicate with each other and
 provide a permanent IP to represent the Pods

* Projects and users, which provide the space and means for communities to
 organize and manage their content together

* Builds and image streams, which let you build working images and react to
 new images

* Deployments, which add expanded support for the software development and
 deployment lifecycle

* Routes, which announce your service to the world

* Templates, which let you create many objects at once based on customized
 parameters
