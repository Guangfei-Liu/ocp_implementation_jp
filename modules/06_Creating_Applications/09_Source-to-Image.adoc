=== Transcript

There are three types of triggers.

* GitHub-specific webhooks specify the repository changes, such as a new commit,
 that invoke a new build. This trigger is specific to the GitHub API.

* The second type is a generic webhook. This trigger is similar to a GitHub
 webhook in that it invokes a new build whenever it receives a notification.

* And an image change trigger is invoked when a new image is available in the
 specified image repository or image stream.
