.Secured TLS termination types - Edge Termination

* A Secured Route definition using Edge Termination:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: Route
metadata:
  name: route-edge-secured
spec:
  host: www.example.com
  to:
    kind: Service
    name: service-name
  tls:
    termination: edge            <1>
    key: |-                      <2>
      BEGIN PRIVATE KEY
      [...]
      END PRIVATE KEY
    certificate: |-              <3>
      BEGIN CERTIFICATE
      [...]
      END CERTIFICATE
    caCertificate: |-            <4>
      BEGIN CERTIFICATE
      [...]
      END
----

<1> The `*termination*` field is `edge` for edge termination.
<2> The `*certificate*` field is the contents of the PEM format certificate file.
<3> The `*key*` field is the contents of the PEM format key file.
<4> An optional CA certificate may be required to establish a certificate chain for validation.

NOTE: Because TLS is terminated at the router, connections from the router to
the endpoints over the internal network are not encrypted.
