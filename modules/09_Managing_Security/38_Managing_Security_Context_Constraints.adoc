== Managing Security Context Constraints

.Enable Images to Run with USER in the Dockerfile

* To relax the security in your cluster so that images are not forced to run as
a pre-allocated UID, without granting everyone access to the *privileged* SCC:

. Edit the *restricted* SCC:
+
----
$ oc edit scc restricted
----

. Change the `*runAsUser.Type*` strategy to *RunAsAny*.

IMPORTANT: This allows images to run as the root UID if no _USER_ is specified
in the _Dockerfile_.
