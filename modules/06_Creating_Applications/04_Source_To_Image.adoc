.What Is S2I?

* Source-to-Image (S2I) is a tool for building reproducible Docker images.
It produces ready-to-run images by injecting a user source into a docker image
and assembling a new docker image.
** The new image incorporates the base image (called: "builder images") and
built source, and is ready to use within OpenShift or other platforms. (e.g
  RHEL Atomic)
** S2I supports incremental builds, which re-use previously downloaded
dependencies, previously built artifacts, etc.

=== Transcript

The S2I, Source to Image  build is a process in which a developer points to a
code repository in any of the supported frameworks and selects a "builder"
image that will contain the operating system and framework to support the code.

To start an S2I build, your code must reside in a supported code repository and
you need a base or builder image, for example `ruby-20-rhel7`, on top of which
to start building. These base images are available built in  to
OpenShift Enterprise--you do not need to create them yourself.

This illustration shows the key differences between a Docker build and an
S2I build.
