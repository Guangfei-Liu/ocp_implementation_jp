== Scheduler
:noaudio:

.Scheduler Policy
* The selection of the predicate and priority functions defines the policy for
the scheduler.
* Administrators can provide a JSON file that specifies the predicates and
priority functions to configure the scheduler.
** The path to the  scheduler policy file can be specified in the master
configuration file.
* In the absence of the scheduler policy file, the default configuration gets
applied.

NOTE: That the predicates and priority functions defined in the scheduler
configuration file will completely override the default scheduler policy.
If any of the default predicates and priority functions are required,
they have to be explicitly specified in the scheduler configuration file.
