== Service Accounts


.Overview

* When using CLI or web console, user's API token authenticates to OpenShift
 Enterprise API.
* When regular user's credentials not available, components can make API calls
 independently using service accounts.
* Examples:
** Replication controllers make API calls to create/delete pods
** Applications inside containers make API calls for discovery
** External applications make API calls for monitoring/integration

* Service accounts provide flexible way to control API access without sharing
 user credentials

=== Transcript

When a person uses the command line or web console, that user's API token
 authenticates him or her to the OpenShift Enterprise API. However, when a
  regular user's credentials are not available, it is common for components to
   make API calls independently. For example:

* Replication controllers can make API calls to create or delete pods.
* Applications inside containers can make API calls for discovery purposes.
* External applications can make API calls for monitoring or integration
 purposes.

Service accounts provide a flexible way to control API access without sharing a
 regular user's credentials.
